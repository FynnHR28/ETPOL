For those not from the states, its quite common to crate a final research paper and presentation on a subject of which you are passionate about, thus my selection of this topic, specifically about solutions. However, as we all know, climate change is a very global issue, and I really do believe that perspectives from a variety of different people would immensely strengthen the points Im wanting to make. So here in lies my ask, what I need from the great people of this subreddit. If there is anyone who has a background/education relevant to the subject that might be interested in a short interview for my project, I would be eternally grateful, and of course you would receive credit for your help. The interview would take place over the phone, and would be no longer than 30 minutes ideally, and as soon as possible would be nice.

Is there any information out there about more detailed causes of global warming? Is human-made greenhouse gas output the definitive key factor?

I keep thinking about how we pump heat out of our homes during summer and inevitably radiate it from our settlements in winter. We use all kinds of devices from smartphones to gargantuan data centers that all shed waste heat. All 8 billion of us produce heat as part of being alive. The majority that uses animal products creates incentive for farming animals that also produce heat.

From the paper's conclusions:

&gt;Over 16 years of Reddit posts show a decreasing proportional interest in climate-related topics. While the absolute number of climate discussions has increased, the expansion of other topics on Reddit has outpaced it, suggesting a relative decline in engagement with climate issues. This trend might be attributed to various factors, including topic fatigue, competition from other crises, and the emergence of other engaging topics.

The authors also noted that redditors talk about ""global warming"" in different ways from ""climate change,"" where ""discussions about global warming tend to use less sophisticated language and exhibit more positive sentiments compared to those about climate change.""

"2025-01-03",1735922750,"Waste Industry","I've been doing quite some research into the waste industry and its connection to Climate Change. 

A major impact to Climate Change in the future will be because of the waste industry and its failures to *recycle/reuse/incinerate* waste in the best way possible.

So far, many countries (yes, even USA) send majority of its trash to landfills which after a decade or more they close up which just leaves the human waste under ground for centuries to come. 

In the USA, landfills are generally safe and operated well so that methane gas doesn't leak into the ground or the environment easily unless their protection layers fail.

But in countries where regulations aren't easily followed, landfills are a huge hazard to the environment and the effects aren't seen until years later. 

I started looking into this industry with a goal of opening up a business or innovating in the industry.

However, I have two concerns:
- The financial capital required to even get the foot in this specific industry is out of reach for the majority of the people that'll actually be affected by climate change.
- Is there even a point given the direction that laws and countries are headed in in regards to Climate Change control?

If you are currently a business owner in this industry or even in Climate Change industry, I'd love to hear what you do as well.","climatechange",9,"https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1hsqre3/waste_industry/"

These countries include Maldives, Kiribati, Tuvalu, and the Marshall Islands. The Maldives will most likely survive due to its economy influenced by high tourism, but the other countries, especially Kiribati and Tuvalu, have already given up and are looking for alternative solutions. Kiribati purchased land from Fiji, and Tuvalu asked Meta to preserve its identity using the metaverse. The Marshall Islands are still trying, but its future is uncertain.

There are other countries like Nauru, Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Bahamas, and Barbados. The Bahamas and Barbados have money and influence, so maybe they will go for artificial islands or something similar. However, what about these three countries? I noticed they also have low-lying atolls but also have higher ground. What are these countries' governments doing in order to survive indefinitely? Are they doing enough to tackle climate change? I believe that these countries, if they try, can definitely survive for a long time. What do you all think? Would these countries survive a major catastrophe like the complete melting of the Greenland ice sheets? I read that island countries are very likely to survive any global disaster.

I don't do a new chart every year, but I've since updated my picture with the ranges in 2022 and 2024.

So, temperatures are getting higher, but I'm surprised by how CONSISTENTLY they're getting higher. In my part of North Carolina we had seven days in 2024 of 100+ degree weather, something that happened twice in 2022 and not at all in any of the previous years. The thing that worries me the most are the days with the yellow circle in the center. Those are days where the temperature never dropped below 73 degrees, even in the middle of the night. That happened 23 times in 2018, 35 times in 2020, 40 times 2022, and 50 times in 2024. Some of those times the low temp would be as high as 78 degrees. It's interesting, in a terrifying way. I really would like to see charts from other regions to see if there are similar results outside of NC (which, to be honest, has always had crazy weather.)

Before the plunge in temperatures at the end, you can see Earth at 18°C even AFTER the Anctartic Circumpolar Current had appeared.


This is very significant, because this means that some 600 ppm of CO² could get us to the limit of the icehouse/greenhouse.
That would be, no Greenland, West Anctartica, Arctic sea ice; only a diminished East Anctartica would remain.

I doubt about more emissions and defeating the continental configuration that keeps our planet cold because of the location of Anctartica (so no Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum).

"2025-01-15",1736931025,"Why is climate change so underestimated???","I am extremely sorry to be writing this post, and for there to be any need to write this post, but it needs to be said: Climate change is severely downplayed by the media.

We at the moment are causing temperature change akin to a literal fucking [asteroid strike](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/09/19/earth-temperature-global-warming-planet/) (if on this graph it seems small to you, consider that it the X axis is **millions of years**, and we caused this momentous temperature rise over 200 years), similar changes which were observed in most mass extinction event. Our best (and only!) hope is to reduce emissions done to a **net-zero** the following 25 years to keep temperatures below 1.5 degrees Celsius, and achieve a **negative net-zero** with Direct Air Capture and massive reforestation, which is almost certainly not possible as:

1. Our efforts aren't as nearly as great to make a system that captures carbon out of the atmosphere, with a net negative effectiveness (meaning not producing more carbon emissions than it captures). Oh, and did I forget to mention that if we by some miracle do this, we need a place to store the annual  **20-30 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide** we emit that are set to increase?
2. Neither is our carbon pollution mitigation effort really making a [dent](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-atmospheric-carbon-dioxide), 2023 and 2024 are record breaking years for producing carbon.
3. Climate change is an exponentially worsening crisis. By making more emissions yearly, we destroy the majority of natural carbon sinks, like[ ice caps, glaciers](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11394-4), [rainforests](https://research.noaa.gov/deforestation-warming-flip-part-of-amazon-forest-from-carbon-sink-to-source/), and [the ocean](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/quantifying-ocean-carbon-sink), releasing even more carbon, and limiting the storage of already existing carbon. (the ocean is being acidified, not really destroyed if you do not consider it's inhabitants, but it is still not good.)
4. [We are still building new coal plants](https://globalenergymonitor.org/report/boom-and-bust-coal-2024/). I am just speechless for this one, we will never meet the Paris Agreement's set goals if we continue doing this.

It is fully understandable to be afraid of the future that we are heading to, I myself am afraid, but panic and fear are the worst reactions possible to a crisis, so please, inform yourself, avoid misinformation/disinformation, and spread whatever trustworthy news you can, awareness is the best thing to happen, and may even lead to some changes for the better. Hard times are to come, and you are the only people that are able to influence it even a single bit, information is our best hope, and may it reach those who can change things, and drive them to do the best.","climatechange",590,"https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1i1taxc/why_is_climate_change_so_underestimated/"

"2025-01-13",1736788532,"If Americans embraced winter more - we wouldn't be living in such odd locations and would be massively more climate resiliant","There's a lot of hoopla on this channel about disasters and why people live in these spots that are disaster prone like the LA hills. Drilling down into peoples actual mindsets though, the biggest thing most Americans actually fear - is a snowstorm. They'll put up with absurd amounts of other risks just to get away from the snowflakes.

When I lived in Atlanta for 2 years, I discovered a lot of people put ATL on their list because further north, there was the possibility of snow (like more than this last storm) and that was simply unacceptable. Like Kentucky isn't exactly an icebox, but it was out of consideration for a MASSIVE chunk of Americans because it snows there.

The vast majority of the godawful risky urban development that the US has is specifically in the no snow zone. That's how Florida, Phoenix, and SoCal spawned into such massive places with populations WAY above what would be normal. Most of the western US, which is actually the least risky disaster wise (floodplains should never be underestimated as Asheville displayed), is off peoples list due to the fact that the bulk of the area actually has a long winter period. The western US is a lot colder than it's eastern latitudes due to elevation.

The ironic thing is winter has never been easier. Think about it, pretty much every car is AWD. How did those rear wheel drivers do it in the past? Look at what they had for winter clothes in the 60's. The stuff was crap! Wool and rubber boots. The winter gear we have today is cheap relatively and simply amazing. I've never been actually cold while out snowmobiling.

Winter nightly lows are fastest warming metric of all climate. It really isn't as bad as it used to be. Minnesota used to be a wasteland of cold where -40s were something that happened in the winter. That's godawful temps, and they really don't happen anymore up there. Look at this last vortex, it was a breeze compared to the 2014 one, which really sucked (we visited MN when it happened). The reason beetles are chomping through the boreal spruce and lodgepole in the Rockies is the absence of -40F temps, again, gone.

So, I believe one of the most impactful thing we can do to influence people to make better climate decisions is to advocate for winter actually being an enjoyable season and combating this irrational fear that surrounds the season. If people lived in better locations, that would fix so much of the crisis that is climate change for the US.","climatechange",201,"https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1i0j00j/if_americans_embraced_winter_more_we_wouldnt_be/"

The app will say ""okay, do you want a minibus for $10 or a car for $20?"" You choose the bus/van, and you are picked up at 7:15 and dropped off to work at 7:40 in an autonomous electric vehicle. No driving or parking hassles, much cheaper and more efficient than today's public transportation. The van logs 300,000 km (200,000 mi) per year but batteries now last for 8 million kilometers, so there's far less battery and other waste to deal with. Transportation nirvana, far fewer vehicles on the roads, a big win for the climate, and quite doable with current infrastructure except for some additional power generation. Still waiting for battery and AI tech to mature some more but that will come, probably within five years.

"2025-01-12",1736701791,"How do greenhouse gases absorb so much radiation when they're so rarely found?","I was hoping this forum could give me an intuitive explanation for this problem. I understand that about 90% of terrestrial radiation is absorbed by greenhouse gases. I also understand that about 50% of terrestrial absorption is done by H2O, which leaves the other 50% to be done by CO2, O3, and CH4, which constitute, in combination, approximately only 0.04% of the atmosphere's mass (99% of that being CO2, which itself only accounts for 20% of absorption). How is it possible that only 0.04% of the atmosphere accounts for the absorption of 45% of terrestrial radiation?

I've read some answers along the lines of ""Due to their triatomic structures, these molecules are able to change their symmetries and 'bend' and 'stretch' to absorb photons over a large range of wavelengths."" This is quite unsatisfying, and not just because I am somewhat weak on the physics of what this means, but also because it doesn't do much to quell the intuition that light, being as small as it is, ought not to be able to be absorbed so consistently by something that is found in the atmosphere so rarely, regardless of its ability to ""stretch and bend.""

When I imagine this in my head, I sort of imagine it from the perspective of a photon, who sees the sky as a net through which it aims to transcend such that the concentration of GHGs corresponds with how large the holes in the net are. Hence, given a concentration of 0.04%, my intuition is that the rate at which photons encounter these gases on their way to space ought to be low, and certainly not 45%.

Just a disclaimer: I don't need reminding that human intuition did not evolve to account for the absorption properties of invisible molecules; I'm perfectly willing to accept my intuition is wrong! But I haven't been able to locate many sources online that really go into the physics of this phenomenon, let alone intuitively.

To my surprise, they weren't hard to find? For people who currently have homes, most likely they are made out of wood, it might be covered in plaster, and insulated I hope? I don't know why wood has been the chosen material to build homes, wood is extremely vulnerable to fire, but if that's what you're living in, here's a few ways to protect it if there's a fire coming near. Get an extensive sprinkler system, or buy a bunch of cheap sprinklers and diy a system all around your house, and any extended property like a garage -install the sprinklers especially on your roof. Then you might want to get something that will hold quite a bit of water, so if you're faucets inside stop flowing, you have your private reserve at the ready. If the fire comes near, turn your sprinklers on and saturate your home, the roof sprinklers are the most important, make sure they're going full blast, and leave it on, even if you have to evacuate, leave the sprinklers on... It should save anything that is soaked, fire won't burn that. The other option if you don't want to use water is to get a tank of fire retardant, and put that through the sprinkler system, for extra security. 

For anyone rebuilding, for crying out loud, don't use wood to build your new house! Use bricks, stone, concrete, use building material that is fire resistant. Those materials will hold together for a long time, but while you're at it, make it earthquake proof as well, yes that can be done, it's a matter of stacking things in a pattern, they might sway a little in a quake, but they'll come out standing strong. Make sure the roof is fire proof, and don't plant anything around the house, put plants in fireproof planters all around the house, and give it fire resistant insulation, you should wind up with a safe haven to call your new home. 

The best way to live in this land, is to get to know the environment you're living in, and build according to what you might encounter?

* December 2024 was the second-warmest December globally, after December 2023, with an average ERA5 surface air temperature of 13.42°C, 0.76°C above the 1991-2020 average for December.
* December 2024 was 1.69°C above the pre-industrial level and was the 17^(th) month in the last eighteen for which the global-average surface air temperature was more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.  
* The global-average temperature for 2024 is 0.72°C higher than the 1991-2020 average, which is the highest annual average on record, and 0.12°C warmer than the average for 2023, the warmest year prior to 2024.
* 2024 is 1.6°C warmer than the pre-industrial level and the first year that has exceeded the threshold of 1.5°C, according to ERA5.

Sea surface temperature

* The average sea surface temperature (SST) for December 2024 over 60°S60°N was 20.58°C, the second-highest value on record for the month, 0.21°C below the December 2023 record.
* SSTs were below average over the central equatorial Pacific, but close to or above average over the eastern equatorial Pacific, suggesting a slowing or stalling of the move towards neutral or La Niña conditions. SSTs remained unusually high in many other ocean basins and seas.

Since we do not know the natural energy flows into, and out of, the climate system to an accuracy better than about 5 to 10 Watts per square meter, and the warming in 235 to 245 Watts per square meter of energy in and out of the climate Recent, weak warming of the global oceans corresponds to less than 1 Watt per square meter of net energy input (an energy imbalance) This is much less than our uncertainty in the NATURAL energy flows of 235 to 245 Watts per square meter Thus, climate change could be mostly NATURAL, and we would not know it recent decades is known (from the rate of ocean warming) to be only about 0.8 Watts per square meter (about 1% of the average flows), this means that recent warming of the climate system could be mostly natural and we would not even know it.""

I understand the obvious link between increased CO2 emissions &amp; global warming (greenhouse effect).  However, I've seen news articles linking climate change to a bunch of other weather patterns -- everything from hurricanes to extreme cold to droughts &amp; fires.  I don't quite follow the direct link and was wondering if someone can provide more data / science behind this.

My gut feeling would be:

1. The average temperature is getting warmer (and may cascade due to polar ice melt)
2. This is causing weather changes &amp; rise in sea level which could affect coastal communities
3. Some win and some lose, some places see additional rain, and others see additional drought, others may see more mild winters &amp; a longer growing season, which could be good or bad, just different.
4. Hurricanes/storms/events may be more prevalent in some places, and less prevalent in others, due to these changes
5. But are there really ""more hurricanes"" on ""stronger storms"" or ""more polar vortex cold spells"" in aggregate, e.g. compared to historical patterns from the early 1900s?

I always had the intuition that the atmosphere would produce an insulating effect, even without the presence of greenhouse gases (GHGs).



I understand that, as a perfect blackbody radiator, the Earth's temperature can be calculated to be -18 degrees (assuming the 239W/m\^2 measured terrestrial output power is correct) via the Stefan Boltzmann equation, and that the absorption and re-emittance of terrestrial longform infrared radiation by GHGs creates an warming effect.



My question is, what other factors produce warming effects at the surface of the Earth, and what percentage of the total thermal increase can be ascribed to the presence of GHGs?



Someone told me that the adiabatic lapse rate has a heating effect, quote:



""As air rises, it expands and cools without exchanging heat with its surroundings. This establishes a vertical temperature gradient that retains heat near the surface, even in a hypothetical scenario with no GHGs. The adiabatic lapse rate, , is governed by:



 = g / c\_p



where g is the gravitational acceleration and c\_p is the specific heat capacity at constant pressure. This provides a baseline insulating effect independent of atmospheric composition, meaning Earths surface temperature would still be higher than 255 K even in the absence of GHGs.""



Is this true? And, if so, is there a way to calculate the warming effect produced by the adiabatic lapse rate?","climatechange",6,"https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1hvwzfc/greenhouse_effect_versus_adiabatic_lapse_rate/"

* The temperature should have been falling in late 2024 as El Nino comes to an end, but it increased
* We saw +0.16°C warming per year on average over the last 3 years
* Obsession over ""net zero"" emissions is missing another major contributor, Albedo. Because of this, many predictions about the temperature leveling off after hitting net zero are wrong and the temperature is more likely to continue to accelerate.
* Temperatures will accelerate well beyond the worst case scenario
* We are so far off of predictions that we are in ""uncharted territory""

Behrens pointed out that *converting plants into animal products wastes a staggering 80 to 97 percent of the calories initially present in the crops.* To produce one kilogram of beef, for instance, a cow must consume 25 kilograms of animal feed.  Behrens explained that humanity is exceeding six of nine planetary boundaries, which are thresholds that define a safe operating space for our planet.  Each of the four boundaries linked to animal agriculture paints a grim picture:

1. **Biosphere Integrity:** The loss of biodiversity is directly tied to habitat destruction caused by agricultural expansion. Farming animals displaces native species and fragments ecosystems, pushing many species toward extinction.
2. **Land System Change:** The conversion of forests and grasslands into agricultural land disrupts natural ecosystems, reducing carbon sequestration and exacerbating climate change.
3. **Freshwater Use:** Animal agriculture is one of the largest consumers of freshwater, contributing to water scarcity in many regions.
4. **Biogeochemical Flows:** The overuse of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers to grow animal feed leads to pollution of waterways, causing dead zones and disrupting aquatic ecosystems.

In the table of California wildland fires from 2016 to January 26, 2025, the sum of the areas burned by wildland fires is 11,984,580 acres or [18,726](https://www.kylesconverter.com/area/acres-(international\)-to-square-miles) sq mi ([48,500](https://www.kylesconverter.com/area/acres-(international\)-to-square-kilometres) sq km).  
               
18726 square miles might be easier to imagine by thinking of a wall of flames up to 100-200 feet (30-61 m) high, that was not stopped by rivers, lakes, pavement, or anything else, and burned a footprint that was on average 2 mi (3.2 km) wide over a distance of about 9,360 miles (15,063 km), amounting to a burn footprint covering an area of 18,720 square miles (48,485 sq km), or about 6 sq mi (16 sq km) less than the total burn area of wildland fires in California from 2016 through January 26, 2025.     
             
A burn footprint 2 mi (3.2 km) wide and 9,360 mi  (15,063 km) long would reach from the 9/11 Memorial in New York City to Seattle to San Diego to Phoenix to Dallas to Jacksonville to Chicago to Las Vegas to Sturgis, South Dakota, and to a final destination located about 60 mi (97 km) southwest of Salt Lake City, according to great circle distances measured with the Google Earth Pro desktop application.","climatechange",1,"https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1ib5ayo/global_warming_is_driving_the_increasing_risk_of/"

Like many of you, I am quite worried about the future of NOAA - the current hiring freeze may be the first step in a direction of dismantling the agency. If you ever used any of their datasets, you will intuitively understand how horrible the implications are if we were to lose access to them. 

To prevent catastrophic loss of everything NOAA provides, I had an idea to decentralize datasets and subsequently assign ""gatekeepers"" to store one chunk of a given dataset, starting with GHCND; locally and accessible to others on either Google or Github. I have created a discord server to start the early coordination of this. I am planning to put that link out as much as possible and get as many of you as possible to join and support this project. Here is the server invite: [https://discord.gg/Bkxzwd2T](https://discord.gg/Bkxzwd2T)  
  
Mods and Admins, I sincerely hope we can leave this post up and possibly pin it. It will take a coordinated and concerted effort of the entire community to store the incredible amount of data.

I am a Physics Honors student at Delhi University. Over the past several years, I have been studying climate change in depth, understanding its physics, mathematics, economic impact, societal effects, and much more.

I am currently working on a unique solution that, when sprayed from the sky using simple hydrogen balloons, can sequester CO2 with very low activation energy. This solution will not only capture CO2, but it will also store it for millennia in solid form once it falls to the ground. Additionally, it has the potential to enrich the soil and benefit both humans and the environment, without causing any harm.

I plan to file a patent for this invention and need to publish my research paper. I am conducting this independent study and require some financial assistance to acquire the necessary instruments to obtain precise experimental readings. These instruments will be crucial in proving the effectiveness of my solution and in convincing others that it works.

I would be extremely grateful for any help or support you can provide in this process.

I wanted to share some observation regarding the weather here, in Yakutsk. I think it would be interesting to know about the things on the other side of the globe.

Here the average temperatures in January are minus 45 - 35 degrees of Celcius. If it's -50 degrees, kids don't go to schools. Water in the air freezes into ice particles and one should breath slowly lest you damage your lungs. Exposing your skin for over a minute can get you frostbite.

But not today. I checked and it shows that it's -10 degrees outside. It's incredibly warm for our standards, you practically don't need gloves and scarfs for walking around, you don't have to protect the face. Such temperatures are typical for April, when snow starts to actively melt here. It very much looks like spring came 2 months ahead of schedule.

While kids on streets cheer about good weather, adults are concerned. We turn freezers off to save electricity cost and keep some groceries outside such as beef. If the temperature is warmer than -25 then meat can't be stored for long and it can go bad. It's mainly boomers who worry about that and other down to earth things.

Weathermen assure that in a few days things will get back to normal. It is indeed cold as usual in places that are norther than Yakutsk, with 40 degrees temperatures still. It's unknown for how much it will impact flora and fauna, in particular there was problem of bears waking up too early and dying of starvation. Ecosystem is already fragile as it is. 

Maybe it's just an anomaly of nature. Or is it a sign of something more permanent?","climatechange",79,"https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1i8p7bl/its_getting_unusually_warm_in_siberia_today/"

On top of that, I think anthropogenic climate change is real as well and is also a problem. So, this isn't a post by some denier or whatever.

BUT, I see these posts and maps and articles talking about how a 3-4 degree global temperature increase will basically render almost everything south of Canada or Siberia a desolate arid wasteland.

And that doesn't make sense to me. We are currently in an ice age, and are on the warming swing of an ice age, and human activity is exacerbating that warming for sure, but the plant has been WAY warmer at different times in the past, and we don't see the world as an arid mad-max style desert. If anything, we see a world that is significantly more dense with vegetation and large swathes of the world effectively becoming a perpetual rainforest for millions of years on end.

Where is this notion that the world getting hotter means it will all turn into a desert coming from, rather than what seems to be the more likely scenario to me, which is that a lot of lands that are now quite temperate become more similar to tropical and sub tropical rainforests. It's not like the water goes away. And with ever smaller ice caps there is only more and more water being dumped into the system.

So it seems to me the real impact to human habitation is land loss to rising sea levels and water tables. Not a global drying out.

Calm weather leaves Britain highly reliant on ageing fleet of gas-fired power stations

Jonathan Leake
22 January 2025 2:22pm GMT
Wind power has collapsed to less than 1pc of Britains electricity supply as some of the stillest weather in years hits the UK and Europe.

The dunkelflaute spell sent winter wind farm output to what is thought to be its lowest since 2015  when there were far fewer turbines.

Near-zero wind speeds and low temperatures have left the UK dependent on France, Norway, Belgium and Denmark to keep the lights on through much of today, with the countries collectively supplying more than 10pc of the UKs electricity through undersea cables.

It follows Tuesdays attack on wind farms by Donald Trump, who halted developments in US waters and called the turbines inefficient, ugly and a threat to wildlife.

The lack of wind also left Britain highly reliant on its ageing fleet of gas-fired power stations which were providing over 60pc of its electricity.

It meant that the National Energy System Operator (Neso) had to call in expensive extra capacity. At around noon on Wednesday, the Connahs Quay 2 power station was offered £745 per megawatt hour to start generating.

The normal price of power is around £100. The extra costs of that power will eventually find their way onto consumer bills.

Similar spells of minimal wind output have hit before, for example in May 2020, but almost always in spring and summer when warm weather means demand is far lower.

On winter days, UK electricity demand is typically around 35GW in the daytime but peaks at around 45GW in the evening. On very cold evenings it can hit nearly 50GW.

The UKs 12,000 wind turbines typically provide around 10GW, but output can reach 23GW when the wind is blowing strongly.

However, for most of Wednesday morning the output of all 12,000 turbines was under 200MW  roughly what could be expected from just 30 large turbines on a windy day.

It meant wind farms were effectively contributing nothing to the UK power system  and on a cold winter day when evening demand was yet to peak.

The Met Office had warned of the likely calm spell  giving Neso time to make preparations.

It said winds over the UK, North Sea and neighbouring countries were set to be extremely light until Thursday evening, after which Storm Eowyn was due to arrive, with winds up to 100mph predicted on Friday.

Asked what preparations it was making for the calm spell Neso said: We cannot provide a running commentary on the operation of the electricity network.

However the last few days were among the tightest seen on the UK power grid in recent years. Ratcliffe-on-Soar in Nottinghamshire, the UKs last coal-fired power station, would have provided an extra 2GW of power  enough to offer a comfortable safety margin, but it was shut down last September to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Richard Tice, the Reform UK energy spokesman, said: Trump is right about wind turbines  they are ugly expensive and harm wildlife including huge marine life damage.

People who invest by relying on subsidies for their long term viability should not be surprised that eventually people wake up and say this is wrong. I have no sympathy. Short-term subsidies may be justifiable but not long-term ones for investors.","climatechange",46,"https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1i7zumw/wind_power_collapse_uk/"

But I cannot find that tweet anywhere and have yet to find any other sources that make similar claims.

CMIP3 from 2005 predicted a trend of +0.21 C.decade-1 from 1979 through 2024. The current observed trend is +0.20 ± 0.05 C.decade-1 making for a nearly spot on prediction. It is too early to make any definitive conclusions regarding whether the recent acceleration in the warming will continue and whether we are starting to pull away from the model prediction. But, as can be clearly seen we cannot eliminate this possibility.

The \[[Hansen et al. 2023](https://academic.oup.com/oocc/article/3/1/kgad008/7335889)\] prediction of an acceleration in warming up to +0.36 C.decade-1 may be starting to play out.

Why is it the most important?

Seeing as how the Atlantic is mostly ""cut off"" from the rest of the world by the continents, how is it so critical to the whole world and not just the proximate continents?

On a planet that is 70% water, surely there must be other underwater currents that are similarly important even if not *as* important?

If there are other important currents, what are their names?

Are they also being monitored?  Are they also failing?  What landmasses do they affect and how?

"2025-01-20",1737370283,"Research about Reddit's Algorithms and Climate Change ","Hello! My names Cameron, a PhD researcher from the University of Manchester, UK.  This is my research account, which Ill be using to investigate the relationships between climate change, social media, and algorithms. The bulk of my work will be ethnographic, a fancy phrase for just observation, immersion, and participation within climate change subreddits. In this post, you can find all the key information about my research; please take the time to read it in your own time, and feel free to discuss it with others if you wish. Please contact me directly via email ([cameron.coakley@manchester.ac.uk](mailto:cameron.coakley@manchester.ac.uk)) if theres anything thats unclear, if you would like more information, or you would be interested in taking part in this research. Thanks!

**About the research**

Ø  **Who will conduct the research?**

Cameron Coakley, from the Department of Geography at the University of Manchester ([https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/cameron-coakley](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/cameron-coakley)) 

Ø  **What is the purpose of the research?**

Through this research I will be trying to understand how members of climate change Subreddits understand, view, and feel about, algorithms and social media platforms. I am also hoping to understand how members of these subreddits imagine and view the future regarding climate change, and what they hope and want from social media going forward. 

Ø  **What am I doing here?**

Primarily, I will be observing how your subreddit works, and how Reddit as a social media platform serves people interested in climate change. As part of this, I will be reading, thinking about, and taking notes on the sort of things I read here, and may make copies of posts that are relevant to my research. These copies will be completely anonymised, and wont be directly quoted in my research, but will inform it. More information about this is below.

Ø  **Will the outcomes of the research be published?**

The primary outcome of this research will be a doctoral thesis (hopefully), but may also include published articles and presentations at conferences. You will not be identifiable in any of these. I will also make a post to my Reddit profile when anything related to this research is published.  

Ø  **Who has reviewed the research project?**

This project has been reviewed by the SEED (School of Environment, Education and Development) Ethics Committee at the University of Manchester.

**What would my involvement be?**

Ø  **What would I be asked to do if I took part?**

Nothing  you are not obliged to do anything specifically for this part of the research. I may interact with you on posts/comments, and may later put out a public advertisement inviting yourself and other Reddit users for an interview, but you will be provided with further details and asked for your consent at that time. This would be done via email. 

Ø  **Will I be compensated for taking part?**

There is no compensation for taking part in any part of this research.

Ø  **What happens if I do not want to take part or if I change my mind?**

If you wish for me to exclude my future interactions with yourself or any future content (comments, posts etc.) produced by you from my research, please contact me directly at [cameron.coakley@manchester.ac.uk](mailto:cameron.coakley@manchester.ac.uk). Because the copies of posts I make will be anonymised as soon as they are collected, I wont be able to remove data that has already been collected from my study. If you would like further information about this, please contact me via email.

**Data Protection and Confidentiality**

Ø  **What information will you collect about me?** 

As part of observations, I may record fieldnotes about public interactions I have had within subreddits. These may contain quotes, which would be paraphrased if included in a published output of this research. I may also collect screen-captures of specific posts, particularly when the post is an image or video. No personal identifiable information will be collected, and copies of posts will be entirely anonymised (usernames and any personal information will be removed, and the original copy deleted). 

Ø  **Under what legal basis are you collecting this information?**

We are collecting and storing this personal identifiable information in accordance with UK data protection law which protect your rights.  These state that we must have a legal basis (specific reason) for collecting your data. For this study, the specific reason is that it is a public interest task and a process necessary for research purposes. This research is being conducted in accordance with Reddits Terms and Conditions, User Agreement, Privacy Policy, and Public Content Policy. 

 

Ø  **Will my participation in the study be confidential and my personal identifiable information be protected?** 

 

·      Data from posts will be anonymised immediately after it is collected, and the original (unanonymised) version deleted.

·      Data will be stored on my personal, encrypted laptop, before being uploaded to a secure University of Manchester server.

o   At the end of the project we will deposit a fully anonymised dataset\] in an open data repository where it will be permanently stored. We will use ICPSR. Researchers at other institutions and others can access the anonymised data directly from the repository and use it for further research or to check our analysis and results.

Ø  **What if I have a complaint?** 

If you have a complaint that you wish to direct to members of the research team, please contact:

I try to live my life in a mostly sustainable way. I don't own a car, I bike everywhere, or take the train. After COVID, I didn't take a plane for 4 years. I eat almost 100% vegetarian (seasonal / local). My house is energy efficient, etc. 

Recently, I've been thinking about taking a short (5 day) trip to Spain. I suffer quite a bit from Seasonal Depression because of the bleak winter weather here in Northwestern Europe. Soaking up some sun sounds like just what I need. 

Usually I travel around Europe by high speed train, but the only way this particular trip is viable time-wise (combined with my job) is by flying.

Should I avoid taking this trip? Or is it not that big of a deal? The reason I struggle with this decision is because I feel I am making some sacrifices, yet I see everyone around me not give a F. It makes me question my sanity.

Obviously dont want to doom but as it seems like every year we grow closer to a catastrophe. Now I am well aware of the fact, currently in my twenties, living in rural eastern slovakia, however I myself never researched the matter deeply, only really voted for parties that promote green energy, recycled, learned to not waste water and such. 

Given the current political situation, in my country and worldwide (in a sense that climate change seems to have taken second place to other geopolitical events), I doubt much work will be done in order to prevent major ecological changes, or diseasters. 

So I come here in hopes that you guys might educate me on how to prepare myself, my home and my family. 

As I said i live in a village, as such self sufficiency when it comes to food, is possible if necessary, altough i myself dont have much experience. So yeah thats mostly what I would like to know: 

* What to expect in the next 20 years when it comes to climate in lowland carpathian europe? 
* How to prepare the house, plants and domestic animals (particularly dogs and chickens) for the ecological changes? 
* Is it worth it to invest into solar power now ?
* If I want to grow my own food, what is the best way to manage water ? 

I apologize if this is too much to ask, if so then I would at least appreciate if someone could provide a reliable source to educate myself on such matters, as I myself am not. ","climatechange",5,"https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1i5cbb7/how_to_prepare_for_whats_to_come/"

I kind of feel responsible for contributing to the climate crisis? At least for not helping. It's not like I've made any major changes to my lifestyle, and I really don't know what TO do. I'm not financially stable and I'm just trying to make it through college, and it's not like I'm going to be an Environmental Science major or someone on the front lines.



So many bad things are happening NOW that aren't climate-related that are taking up so much mental bandwidth. Every new thing I learn about how bad climate efforts are going is another wave of existential dread, and while I'm coping, that doesn't mean I'm actually doing anything useful.

  
 I've done my best to stay numb but I kind of feel like I'm slowly drowning? I don't even want to think about 5 years from now, let alone beyond that. I hope things improve, but I feel like shit for staying on the sidelines.

Moss Landing has two battery facilities, one managed by Tesla and one by PG&amp;E, the later built by Vistra. Most past fires were in the Vistra plant, though recall the Tesla site had a fire during installation.

&gt;At night a temperature inversion forms near the ground, trapping volcanic emissions coming from Mauna Loa summit fumarloes in a layer tens of meters thick. Down slope winds sometimes transport these emissions to the observatory, where they are detected as a ""noisy"" increase above smooth baseline levels for some gases. A volcanic component can be estimated by taking the difference in concentration between periods when the plume is present and periods immediately before and after that exhibit baseline conditions.","climatechange",10,"https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1ijj13a/noaa_global_monitoring_laboratory_mauna_loa/"

The attendant turns the car on and leaves it idling for a very long time. The cars at the very front of the line that were dropped off at minimum 30-45 minutes ago are still idling. 

If every rental car agency across America does this everyday for all hours of the day, it greatly increases emissions. 

Some hypothetical math without researching anything:

Lets say 250 major airports across the country all with 6 rental car agencies accepting the return of 50 rentals per day and all of those rentals are idling for 30 minutes. That would be 37,500 hours per day of idling done only by rental cars being returned. An idling car produces 4 pounds of CO2 per hour, so that means an extra 150,000 pounds of CO2 is being emitted into the atmosphere daily by rental car agencies. Or about 14,000 gallons of fuel wasted on idling per day. For seemingly absolutely no reason. With no one in the car.

I initially intended to study astrophysical fluid dynamics, but then I got to see some of the fluid mechanics in atmospheric physics and was immediately hooked.

For me, I would get to study what I want and potentially have a tangible, positive impact on the world. 

Recently, I reached out to my old undergrad advisor for some advice on how to proceed. Instead, he firmly suggested I not look for programs for atmospheric physics or anything similar. To summarize his views:

""I just wouldn't feel right encouraging you to go into a field where funding could potentially disappear under the current administration. This isn't even addressing the fact that I know several climate scientists who are receiving an increasing number of death threats. I encourage you to pursue graduate studies, but I would also encourage you to consider your prospects unless you intend to leave the country altogether"".

Im writing from **Nepal**, a country thats feeling the effects of climate change firsthandmelting glaciers, erratic monsoons, and increasing droughts. Despite contributing **less than 0.1% of global emissions**, Nepal is on the frontlines of the crisis.

Yet, even here, the fight for climate action is growing. From **community-led reforestation projects** to **youth-driven sustainability initiatives**, people are pushing for change despite limited resources. But the reality is tough**climate finance is hard to access**, and many local efforts struggle to scale.

But I do need more experience from other people as well. So, 

I want to ask this community:

* **How can smaller, developing nations like Nepal push for stronger climate action on the global stage?**
* **What strategies have worked in other regions facing similar challenges?**
* **How can individuals (especially those outside government and big organizations) make a real impact?**

It looks like the AMOC collapse is gonna happen pretty soon, and the capacity of forests to act as carbon sinks is already limiting, and might become a source of carbon in the future.

It just looks like the science is firm in the conclusion that we won't be successful. Even if we stopped emitting carbon and hit net zero this very second, the world would continue to warm.

I am building an alternate investment platform for commercial building operators to undertake energy efficiency and solar installation projects.

[https://www.realchangenews.org/news/2024/01/03/seattle-law-requires-large-buildings-reach-net-zero-emissions-2050](https://www.realchangenews.org/news/2024/01/03/seattle-law-requires-large-buildings-reach-net-zero-emissions-2050)

My hypothesis is based on 2 key aspects I found out during customer interviews and secondary research.  
1. Banks often seek collateral for such loans which many building owners are not enthusiastic about.

2. Banks don't like servicing projects with ticket sizes between 400k to 5Mn as they don't give enough return after factoring in the manual underwriting costs. (banks can service lower ticket sizes as they can be underwritten automatically) 

I will create a debt crowdfunding platform where retail and institutional investors can participate and earn better returns than government bonds. Commercial building owners benefit via simpler and cheaper access to capital.

This accelerating ocean surface warming is physically linked to an upward trend in Earth's energy imbalance (EEI). ... Using the statistical model to isolate the trend from interannual variability, the underlying rate of change of GMSST rises in proportion with Earth's energy accumulation from 0.06 K decade1 during 198589 to 0.27 K decade1 for 201923. ... Applying indicative future scenarios of EEI based on recent trends, GMSST increases are likely to be faster than would be expected from linear extrapolation of the past four decades. Our results provide observational evidence that the GMSST increase inferred over the past 40 years will likely be exceeded within the next 20 years. Policy makers and wider society should be aware that the rate of global warming over recent decades is a poor guide to the faster change that is likely over the decades to come, underscoring the urgency of deep reductions in fossil-fuel burning.

Here is a typical comment, from yesterday:

&gt;Ah right. Can you please explain to me how CO2 emitted from the burning of fossil fuels is chemically, physically or in any other way different from CO2 emitted from other sources?

&gt;I was under the clearly misguided impression that the warming effect on the climate was the same, regardless of the source.

The true situation, which there is a desperate need for people to understand, is that our problem is very specifically the movement of carbon from fossil sources to the atmosphere. If carbon is taken from the atmosphere, turned into wood, and then the wood is burned as fuel, then that is just the same amount of carbon cycling around the biosphere. Most fossil carbon was removed from atmosphere millions of years ago, at a time when the climate was much hotter than it is today. Fossil carbon which is put into the atmosphere then starts cycling around, which means the total amount of carbon goes up, which is what is actually causing all of our climate problems.

Surely this is not too difficult to explain to people? The problem, of course, is it logically follows that we need to leave carbon in the ground. And nobody wants to hear that message, because everybody knows that it isn't going to happen.","climatechange",151,"https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1idie9c/we_need_to_change_the_way_climate_change_is/"

Here's a possible explanation that a weakening jet stream explains the freak winter storms in the South in 2025.

&gt;Headlines emerged in the wake of a[ 2012 paper](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2012gl051000) by Jennifer Francis, now at the Woodwell Climate Research Center and Steven Vavrus at the University of WisconsinMadison. Francis and Vavrus proposed that Arctic amplification would lead to weaker west-to-east jet-stream winds and an increased frequency of large north-south-oriented upper-level waves in the atmospheres circulation. They also hypothesized this shift would allow midlatitude weather extremes  in the U.S. and elsewhere  to become more persistent and the impacts more extreme. Francis and colleagues have since expanded on this work in a number of follow-up papers.

&gt;While its clear were seeing fewer cold temperature records being broken as the climate warms, the disruption caused by cold spells is being felt in places where debilitating cold is unusual, and so folks and communities are not prepared for it  like this winter in Louisiana, Florida, Greece, and Saudi Arabia, Francis told Yale Climate Connections by email.","climatechange",14,"https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1iudjld/update_hows_us_winter_weather_changing_in_a/"

My understanding is that the AMOC has a tipping point. Once this is passed, there are still decades left before it fully stops, but beyond the tipping point its collapse cannot be stopped. Im unclear in the email if he means mid-century could be the tipping point, or mid-century could literally be when the AMOC has fully shuddered to a halt (and that therefore we have already passed the tipping point)?

Email from Hansen (https://mailchi.mp/caa/global-warming-has-accelerated-why-what-are-the-consequences?e=e42cfb319f):

""We show that observed ice melt over the past 20 years was similar to assumed ice melt in climate simulations of Ice Melt, Sea Level Rise, and Superstorms.4 The rate of ice melt did not increase in the past decade, but, given the leap of global temperature to +1.5°C above preindustrial, we expect ice melt to accelerate, especially in regions such as southeast Greenland where ice melt is injected directly into the Irminger Sea, a region where deepwater forms. The North Atlantic is warming at depths beneath the surface wind-mixed ocean layer, with warmer water penetrating beneath the sea ice and ice shelves. Paleoclimate data suggest that such sub-ice warming can lead to sudden loss of regional sea ice and thus increased warming and summer rainfall on lower reaches of the Greenland ice sheet and increased freshwater injection into the ocean. **Our climate simulations4 suggest that such increased ice melt and rapid surface warming can shut down the overturning ocean circulation by mid-century, which would be the Point of No Return because shutdown is irreversible in less than centuries.** Large sea level rise would become inevitable, as heat normally transported into the North Atlantic would remain in the Southern Hemisphere and speed melting of the West Antarctic ice sheet. Global warming acceleration increases this danger because the increased heating both reduces the density of the upper layer of the ocean and increases the rate of ice melt.""","climatechange",11,"https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1islrda/james_hansens_latest_amoc_prediction_tipping/"

I was outside this morning clearing the snow and I saw something that is a perfect example of one of the major obstacles to getting people on board with fighting climate change.

My neighbour came here from Italy easily fifty years ago. He's of an older generation from the old world, he has a specific world view that can be quite backwards at times. This is common for older folks, especially if they lack an education.

What I saw, was him start up his snowblower, despite having no need to. He had already cleared his snow last night and was using it to attack tiny bits that would easily be handled with a shovel, even for a senior. He then let it idle for ten minutes while speaking with another neighbour, pumping out poison all the while.

He was outside because it's a social event for retirees: they get outside because they want something to do, and they want to socialize with everyone else who's clearing their snow. Even worse, he's let the engine idle while chatting and the reason for that is very simple: he's not thinking about global warming. It's just not something he would consider.  He's interested in feeling like a man, using his power tools without any consideration of the consequences. The ironic thing is that he's an extremely avid gardener, and would probably be the first to complain if climate change affected that.

The obstacle here is to get people to keep climate change in the back of their mind. We need to overcome a lifetime of neural pathways, forging new ones, which takes a lot of time and effort, even when the subject is willing.

After reading into some of the scientific literature behind burning fossil fuels, cutting down forests and farming livestock increasingly influencing the climate and the earth's temperature, I guess I don't see much possibility in the major world powers deciding to change how society currently functions in order to have any meaningful impact on climate change.

For example, I've been reading that key components to climate change are generating power and burning fossil fuels to produce energy for making things like cement, iron, steel, electronics, plastics, clothes, mining, construction and other industrial processes. Cars, trucks, ships, and planes run on fossil fuels. Producing or farming food causes emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases. Powering buildings, offices, heating, cooling, appliances, etc. Even electric car batteries require mining ore and fossil fuel consumption to produce.

Obviously we need food, transportation, housing, raw materials, and a functioning power grid for civilization as it is today to exist, so would actions such as moving our major power grids to primarily electric/solar/wind sources, walking/biking more, using energy efficient appliances/lights, electric modes of transportation and better building insulation even be enough to make any sort of meaningful impact?

1.        Fossil fuel use cannot be stopped without

A.       Crashing the global economy

B.      Collapse of industrial agriculture

C.      Increasing temperature by the reduction of particulate aerosols which currently block a fraction of incoming sunlight energy

Because:

A.       Over 80% of global energy usage is currently fossil energy based

B.       There has been no effect from current mitigation strategies  emissions only continue to rise.

C.      Electricity is only an energy carrier and not an energy source

D.      Energy sources have only been additive  substitution of one energy source for another has not been achieved or proven possible

Even if fossil fuels were stopped being used tomorrow the earth would continue to heat for centuries to millennia, which will initiate feedback loops increasing overall warming.  Equilibrium is a long way off and the effects of the current greenhouse gas forcing have not been fully realized. 

 

2.        There is no green energy transition or net zero because:

A.       So called green energy relies on fossil inputs when then the entire life cycle is considered.  I.E.  There are not solar panels, nuclear power plants, batteries, or wind turbines without fossil energy to allow for mining the raw materials and manufacturing the devices.  It is not clear that the amount of raw materials required is even possible to mine from the earth.

B.      Net zero does not account for the carbon already released into the atmosphere  there is no draw down of atmospheric carbon dioxide

C.      Carbon capture and storage is a pipe dream.  In reality the technology is resource and energy intensive and cannot be scaled up to make a difference

&gt;^1 Solar includes both solar thermal and solar photovoltaic generation, and where possible distributed solar generation is included.   
&gt;^2 Where possible, Hydro generation excludes any contribution from pumped hydro generation.  
&gt;^3 Bioenergy is classified as renewable, but caveats are attached. See below for details.  
&gt;^4 Other Renewables generation includes geothermal, tidal and wave generation.  
&gt;^5 Other Fossil generation includes generation from oil and petroleum products, as well as manufactured gases and waste.  
       
&gt;_Bioenergy_ has typically been assumed (by the IPCC, the IEA, and many others) to be a
renewable energy source, in that forest and energy crops can be regrown and replenished,
unlike fossil fuels. It is included in many governmental climate targets, including EU
renewable energy legislation, and so Ember includes it in renewable to allow easy
comparison with legislated targets.  
     
&gt;However, the climate impact of bioenergy is highly dependent on the feedstock, how it was
sourced and what would have happened had the feedstock not been burnt for energy.
Current bioenergy sustainability criteria, including those of the EU, generally do not
sufficiently regulate out high-risk feedstocks and therefore electricity generation from
bioenergy cannot be automatically assumed to deliver similar climate benefits to other
renewables sources. Given the availability of risk-free alternatives to generating electricity
such as wind and solar, Ember advocates for countries to minimise or eliminate the inclusion of large-scale bioenergy in the power sector.

All this could be had if Thorium was developed in a way that it could be commercialised. Reactors that could be just for city districts, remote communities, hospitals, container ships etc.

EDIT:
This is to function as a general response to common answers and arguments Ive seen from commenters. I simply dont have time unfortunately to respond to all of them individually so Im lumping it all here . Those who have already made up their minds will ignore it .  Those who are open to the idea may find it a reason to research further .

So here goes nothing : 
There are those who argue that these reactors are financially unviable. They are no doubt financially at a disadvantage to renewables but so were renewables during the stronger years of fossil fuels. Discoveries are made, research carried out, and with time the costs invariably come down. Thats true of most technologies.
So this is more a reluctance to invest and ensure future generations will already get the basics ironed out because, by goodness, theyll have enough shit to deal with, without adding a second energy crisis to the mix.

Aside from the purely financial there is a geopolitical. Most people in Europe are acutely aware of what it is to be dependent on a volatile or unfriendly state for their energy needs. Rare earth elements are found in a number of places the largest of which is China. Those who advocate going purely for renewables such as wind and solar are basically saying that they are happy to be somewhat subject to the whim of Chinas foreign and trade policies.
Personally, I find that unwise. Not to mention that rare earth elements are in shorter supply than thorium is. Recycling techniques will no doubt improve but the likelihood is that these elements will run out in much the same way fossil fuels are doing.
If thorium salt reactors were developed and refined and became a standardised technology the sizeable reserves, its more abundant distribution and the fact it is 3x more plentiful than uranium mean countries like China or the US or Russia wouldnt have quite the same energy monopoly they do now. Put that in the context of how many conflicts have basically been based on acquiring raw materials for energy.
I would very much like for my grandkids, if ever I have any, to grow up in a world where at least that reason for killing each other is taken off the table .
And finally given the gravity of what climate change represents in terms of human survival let alone prosperity , I would argue that having as many tried and tested technologies on the table for future generations to use and enjoy is a good thing even if, right at this particular moment, some are more costly than others. Id argue those future generations would be grateful for us at least getting that right.

TLDR: Molten thorium salt reactors could provide a millenniums worth of energy potentially available in a safe scalable and sustainable technology that gives virtually every country access to the raw fuel without depending on another, thus adding to the climate change arsenal alongside renewables.","climatechange",165,"https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1ilnym3/despite_progress_in_renewables_the_best_chance_to/"

&gt;**Abstract**  
    
&gt;Polar climate change has the greatest long-term effect on humanity, with impacts accelerated by the jump in global temperature. We find that polar ice melt and freshwater injection onto the North Atlantic Ocean exceed prior estimates and, because of accelerated global warming, the melt will increase. As a result, shutdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is likely within the next 20-30 years, unless actions are taken to reduce global warming  in contradiction to conclusions of IPCC. If AMOC is allowed to shut down, it will lock in major problems including sea level rise of several meters  thus, we describe AMOC shutdown as the point of no return.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [par. 3]

&gt;AMOC shutdown deserves special attention, because it likely constitutes the point of no return.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [p. 10, line 303]      
    
&gt;Our present _Acceleration_ paper^1 investigates these issues with more data. We confirm acceleration of global warming and conclude that the +1.5°C global temperature threshold (averaged over El Nino and coming La Ninas) has been breached. The GISS (Goddard Institute for Space Studies) analysis of 12-month running-mean global temperature reached +1.6°C relative to the 1880-1920 mean in August 2024, and then began a slow decline to +1.56 at the end of 2024. If our estimated ship aerosol forcing of 0.5 W/m^2 (several times larger than estimated by IPCC and aerosol modelers) is accurate, global temperature in the next few years will decline at most to ~1.4°C, but it may not even reach that. Earths large energy imbalance assures that warming will continue on a path to +2°C and beyond, unless extraordinary actions are taken to affect that imbalance. There is no need to wait a decade to confirm that the +1.5°C threshold has been reached.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [p. 13, line 451]

Endless desert, ruined buildings,  are just so distant from my perception of the world that i just can't relate enough to feel anything. 

But I grew up in Kansas, so I'm very familiar with endless corn fields. And interstellar shows that... But worse. Just harder to live. Food and water are more scarce. The air is heavy to breath. Dust covers everything. Institutions are failing because people are more angry and distrustful of governments than ever. 

My point is, is that scenario too pessimistic even for our falling world, or is it something that really awaits us if we don't start fixing the issues? Famine isn't something this movie invented. Neither is a dust bowl, one famously caused year-long starvation in the southern states in the 30s.

I had GPT take a deep dive on geothermal&.

# Key Article Insights:

The article discusses **Quaise Energy**, a private geothermal startup deploying advanced **gyrotron** technology (millimeter-wave drilling) to:

Vaporize extremely hard rock formations rapidly using electromagnetic waves.

Potentially reach unprecedented depths (up to 7+ miles) to access hotter geothermal energy (1,000°F+).

Overcome geographical constraints, dramatically expanding geothermal viability beyond current limited areas.

**Geothermal Market Context:**

Geothermal currently constitutes **&lt;1% of U.S. energy**, making its growth potential massive.

The increased power demands from AI-driven data centers and electric vehicle infrastructure are likely to boost geothermal investments significantly.

Geothermal energy aligns with Trumps energy dominance agenda, suggesting favorable policy tailwinds.

# Potential Implications and Beneficiaries:

# Publicly Traded Companies that Could Benefit:

**Ormat Technologies (ORA)**:

Currently the leading publicly traded pure-play geothermal power provider.

Specializes in binary geothermal plants and technology.

Benefits directly from increasing attention and investment in geothermal energy.

Strong existing portfolio and experience would position ORA as a natural beneficiary, especially if Quaise technology expands viable geothermal locations.

**Rating (Geothermal Exposure)**: 9/10**Rationale**: ORA is well-positioned with existing infrastructure, global footprint, and advanced technology. A substantial breakthrough like Quaises would significantly expand ORA's market potential.

**Chevron (CVX), Devon Energy (DVN), BP (BP)**:

Mentioned explicitly as investors in geothermal startups, showing interest in expanding their renewables portfolios.

These companies would have the capital and expertise to scale projects quickly.

However, geothermal represents a small portion of their businessesmeaning impact on stock price would likely be limited compared to their core fossil-fuel business.

**Schlumberger (SLB), Halliburton (HAL), Baker Hughes (BKR)**:

Major oil-service companies with drilling and infrastructure expertise would benefit if gyrotron technology is adopted industry-wide.

Would potentially supply equipment, engineering, or services if technology proves scalable.

# Assessment of Your Current Holding (ORA):

**Strengths**:

Established leader and profitable pure-play geothermal business.

Likely to be an early beneficiary if Quaise technology proves viable.

Limited pure-play geothermal options make ORA the default choice for institutional investors seeking exposure to this niche sector.

**Risks**:

Could face new competition from oil majors diversifying into geothermal.

If Quaise's technology enables widespread geothermal generation, it may reduce barriers to entry, potentially introducing competitors.

**Overall Outlook**:

Short-Term: Limited immediate impact as Quaises technology still needs to be field-tested.

Intermediate-Term: Likely bullish, as increasing geothermal visibility attracts investor interest.

Long-Term: Very bullish, assuming Quaise (or similar technology) proves viable, significantly expanding the global geothermal market. ORA, as the industry leader, is well-positioned.

**Overall Rating for ORA (Geothermal exposure): 8.5/10**

# Analysis of Quaise's Impact on Geothermal as an Industry:

**Technological Potential**: Very high. Quaises tech, if successful, would represent a disruptive breakthrough.

**Implementation Risk**: Also high. Field demonstrations needed, and technology may encounter unforeseen hurdles.

**Economic Feasibility**: Moderate. High upfront costs ($15-$25 billion for 5GW), but scalable and appealing if validated.

**Policy Support**: High, especially under the current Trump administration's pro-energy domestic agenda.

# Conclusion &amp; Recommendation:

**Bullish Long-Term for ORA**: Quaises success would directly amplify Ormats total addressable market (TAM), allowing geothermal plants almost anywhere, dramatically enhancing the attractiveness of ORA as an investment.

**Current Recommendation for ORA**:

**Short-Term (next 1 year)**: Moderate bullishness (**7/10**) due to broader sector momentum.

**Intermediate-Term (1-3 years)**: Strongly bullish (**8.5/10**) if geopolitical pressure and increasing U.S. emphasis on domestic energy production continues.

**Long-Term (3-5 years)**: Extremely bullish (**9/10**) if Quaise (or similar) breakthroughs prove economically viable, creating massive market opportunities for Ormat.

# Strategic Consideration:

This signals an excellent entry point or opportunity to increase exposure to the geothermal space via ORA.

Monitor Quaise closely. If the technology proves commercially viable, consider increasing positions in ORA, Schlumberger (SLB), Baker Hughes (BKR), and other companies that could benefit through equipment and services in expanded geothermal exploration and infrastructure.

# Final Verdict:

**Quaises technology**: Intriguing and potentially disruptive, yet still speculative.

**ORA**: Well-positioned for upside from geothermals increasing visibility and market expansion. Excellent hold or buy-on-dips.

**Oil Services Companies (SLB, HAL, BKR)**: Could also benefit indirectly from broader adoption of deep-drilling technology, albeit on a longer time frame and smaller scale compared to pure-play geothermal (ORA).

One of the most immediately consequential articles IMO:

&gt;President Donald Trumps new executive order to increase [domestic timber production](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/immediate-expansion-of-american-timber-production/) could have a disastrous impact on climate change, endangered species and local economies dependent on ecotourism, conservation groups warned.

&gt;The order, issued over the weekend, claims that heavy-handed Federal policies have prevented full utilization of the nations timber resources and aims to ramp up production of lumber, timber and paper by expediting permitting processes, including requirements set under the Endangered Species Act....

&gt;Anna Medema, the associate director of legislative and administrative advocacy for forests and public lands at the Sierra Club, said increasing timber production would likely target the larger, older trees that are the most critical to protect as climate change accelerates....

&gt;Any opportunities for reform are contradicted by the recent firings at the U.S. Forest Service, \[Nick Pevzner, an assistant professor in landscape architecture and regional planning at the University of Pennsylvania, said,\] which are actually removing the capacity to do the kind of forest management that this order is trying to accelerate.

* February 2025 was the third warmest February globally, with an average ERA5 surface air temperature of 13.36°C, 0.63°C above the 1991-2020 average for February, and only marginally warmer, by 0.03°C, than the fourth warmest of 2020.
* February 2025 was 1.59°C above the estimated 1850-1900 average used to define the pre-industrial level and was the 19th month in the last 20 months for which the global-average surface air temperature was more than 1.5°C above the pre-industrial level.
* The global-average temperature for boreal winter 2025 (December 2024 to February 2025) was the second highest on record at 0.71°C above the 1991-2020 average for these three months, 0.05°C cooler than the record set for boreal winter 2024.
* The 12-month period of March 2024  February 2025 was 0.71°C above the 1991-2020 average, and 1.59°C above the pre-industrial level.

Sea surface temperature

* The average sea surface temperature (SST) for February 2025 over 60°S60°N was 20.88°C, the second-highest value on record for the month, 0.18°C below the February 2024 record.
* SSTs remained unusually high in many ocean basins and seas, though the extent of these regions decreased compared to January, especially in the Southern Ocean and in the southern Atlantic. Some seas, such as the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean Sea, on the contrary, saw larger record-breaking areas than last month.

I'm pessimistic that anything will happen but I'm not giving up, and I'm also explicitly advocating for getting more people to do something about it.***

I'm sorry, but any attempt at baseless optimism won't really be conducive to climate efforts.

You should be panicked, and you should be using that frantic energy to ramp up your efforts, as should everyone be. I will admit that I'm not entirely guilt free in this. I could be doing a lot  more. Regardless, focusing on how it's ""not the end of the world"" isn't useful at all. It almost quite literally is, at least, the end of significant portions of humanity and global biodiversity. The situation is more dire than ever.

The article about how ""The AMOC won't fully collapse by the end of this century"" is cope. They're using the same data and framing it in an unrealistically optimistic way. The same data says that the current could slow down up to 80% by the end of the century. This is a functional collapse. WHY IS THE ARTICLE FRAMING THIS INFORMATION AS IF IT'S A CRISIS AVERTED?

The simple truth is that nothing will be done any time soon unless climate activism increases a hundred-fold. I'll be honest, I don't see that happening, and I'm two steps away from folding to the hopelessness and becoming a doomsday prepper. I just don't see a future in which the world collectively does anything against the ongoing crisis. The most they can do is bury their heads in the sand while focusing on attacking trans people and other marginalized communities while pocketing the money of their own supporters and the everyone else if more billionaires get in direct control of governments like Musk has with the U.S.

""Don't be an ~~doomer~~ alarmist,"" you say but we have to in order to make the waves that we need to at least somewhat mitigate the catastrophe. We need a thousand times more resources, popularity, and positive media coverage. Instead, any actual protests are going to be covered by the media as an extremist, alarmist, outright delusional group event as they strawman and misrepresent the climate struggle to high hell. All the while, the few billionaires controlling the narrative get richer off their oil money. Billions are going to die, a fact which is already baked in. Fascism is on the rise globally. Just a few days ago, the German far right party had a little over 20% support, giving them the second largest share of votes, right behind the conservative party who won the election with 28.52% of the votes. The scary part is that the German far right doubled its support of 10% in 2021 to 20% now in 2025.

It's clear that the far right is going to win, if not in the next election then the one after that, and it WILL have a huge impact on the rest of Europe considering that Germany is the largest economy in the EU. It's not just Trump. The rest of the world refuses to do what they need to in order to curb this catastrophe.

"2025-02-24",1740419205,"Coming to terms with Climate Anxiety","I recently felt a resolution regarding my climate anxiety. I accepted that the near few hundred year future will likely hold a lot of suffering - drought, famine, disease, floods, fires across all species and organisms causing a mass extinction event.

My glimmer of hope lies within the long term opportunities for biodiversity on a geological timescale. The climate is going to change drastically, species will evolve and adapt, and once nature heals our planet will be home to a significantly wider array of life. I imagine ecosystems that harness plastics and pollutants as fuel source, soil and trees that grow on complex roadways and overpasses, and birds that nest high up in abandoned skyscrapers.  Plants will have more carbon as food for material growth, and our polar regions will be habitable for ecological expansion. 

Change is scary, and transition periods shake us up, just like a snowglobe. If we recognize that our few decades of inhabitation are only a blip within the billions of years of life before and after, we can be more optimistic of a future we will never see. 

This is not to say ""keep on polluting, it doesn't matter anyways."" I'm just offering food for thought that makes our journey a little less bleak. Put effort into making lifestyle changes to reduce your impacts, but don't feel guilty when you can't. Life is hard right now, and the system keeps us dependent on plastics, cars, and industries that destroy our ecosystems. None of this is your fault. 

Live your best life in the current moment, and trust that the future will fall into place.","climatechange",38,"https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1ix81un/coming_to_terms_with_climate_anxiety/"

Ive already drastically reduced my red meat consumption, started using a water filter, plan to drive a non-Tesla EV (hopefully) soon, and generally stopped wanting/buying so much stuff and only replacing clothes/tech/etc. when needed. The environment is also one of my top priorities when voting.

However, I do fly relatively regularly. One of my main hobbies is visiting theme parks, so I take 2-3 transcon flights to visit places like Disney World and Universal Orlando. Additionally I join in on 1 or 2 family vacations a year to various other places (usually domestic, but theres a couple international destinations we are planning) and am part of a group of friends that live across the U.S. and we typically fly to meet up once a year.

These 4-6 flights a year are to do things that I enjoy and spend time with people I love, so they contribute a lot to my mental health, happiness, and wellbeing. Its not just to post on social media that I went somewhere. But at the same time, sometimes one flight emits more than what the worlds poor emit in a whole year.

I always take nonstop flights out of my major hub city, fly economy, and am a relatively light packer, so I seem to have the basics covered. However I do feel I can and should be doing more.

Many of my flights are at night, but is it worth potential extra cost and a night of the trip to fly during the day if possible due to the contrail effect? Ive seen conflicting information online on this and wondering if it is significant or not.

Are there any reputable carbon offsetting programs? Many of the programs seem like they dont really accomplish anything, but then again I havent really researched this very much.

Is there something else Im missing that could reduce my impact? Any tips for not being overwhelmed by guilt and anxiety regarding climate change? Or maybe I really should feel guilty for being part of the 10% that flies regularly for leisure and actually need to reconsider my lifestyle, I dont know.

&gt;As of 2022, [about 9.8 percent](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/coal/use-of-coal.php#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20about%20513%20million,share%20since%20at%20least%201949.) of the countrys total energy consumption was coal. 

&gt;Over the past week, Interior Secretary [Doug Burgum ](https://thehill.com/people/doug-burgum/)and Energy Secretary Chris Wright have said the administration [was working on a plan](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-07/us-crafting-plan-to-stem-coal-plant-closures-energy-chief-says) to [stop coal plant closures](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-10/us-eyes-restarting-closed-coal-plants-interior-secretary-says). 

&gt;Burgum has floated using Trumps emergency powers to stop coal plant closures.

&gt;Coal is a significant contributor to climate change and pollution, making it a controversial source of energy; burning it is more carbon-intensive than using even other fossil fuels such as oil and gas.

[Trump seeks to boost coal energy production](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5201155-trump-coal-power-energy-production/)

Increased electricity production from coal not only will increase carbon dioxide emissions, but also soil and water pollution as well as coal ash waste.

&gt;The comments follow plans announced last week for a [sweeping rollback](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/epa-takes-aim-water-air-toxics-protections-part/story?id=119733125) of longstanding regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency -- which the Trump administration is calling the ""biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history.""

&gt;Several of the 31 actions announced by the agency last week targeted prior regulations meant to restrict emissions and pollution related to the use of coal. Chief among these was the announcement to ""reconsider"" President Joe Biden's ""Clean Power Plan 2.0,"" which was a [group of regulations](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/epa-limits-4-types-power-plant-pollution-sweeping/story?id=109579547) targeting coal and natural gas power plants announced last year....

&gt;While coal-fired electricity has become ""cleaner than ever,"" according to the [U.S. Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/articles/clean-coal-crucial-american-jobs-energy-security-and-national-supply-chains#:~:text=Coal-fired%20electricity%20generation%20is,compared%20to%20plants%20without%20controls), the fossil fuel is still responsible for significant greenhouse gas emissions and environment-polluting coal ash. So ""clean coal"" is a bit of a misnomer, sometimes referring to types of technology used to physically clean coal before it is burned or capture carbon related to its burning, according to Michelle Solomon, senior policy analyst at [Energy Innovation](https://energyinnovation.org/bio/michelle-solomon/).

&gt;""Burning coal could never be technically considered clean regardless of the treatment applied to it before combustion  it will always emit the largest concentration of greenhouse gases of any fossil fuel, and soil and water pollution from coal and coal ash (what's left after it's burned) will never go away,"" Solomon said.

(I recommend you to read this entire passage before going off to comments) 

Hi Community,

I am a student developer and I really wanted to do something about climate change , so I started working on a community app that brings people together to work together to reduce their impact on climate change,

and I thought that even if I get a couple thousand people together to make an impact , there could be some change in the world 

but as I was researching about what exact actions can people take to make a change , thats where I was starting to doubt my assumptions , and when I got to know about the disparity that most of the emissions are made by the top 1-10% of wealthy people and the middle and bottom 90% people's emissions are nothing in comparision to their massive amount.

And honestly getting to know this did made me rethink about my community app idea.

Now I'm not saying that no impact can be made by the rest 90% of the people or everything is doomed,

but I am just wondering how much can we really do about the situation?

what actions can individuals take to make an impact ?

To follow up on my previous post about whether we're making real progress on climate change or just fooling ourselves, I wanted to focus on actionable solutions. While it's clear that significant policy changes and international commitments play a crucial role in addressing climate change, there's a lot we can do at an individual level, too.

Sure, there's absolutely tons of totally unnecessary air travel happening in the U.S. There are 14 flights a day between the Miami area and Orlando, including on low cost carriers that probably don't have many connecting passengers, despite the existence of Brightline. It's more comfortable, cheaper (especially after airline fees), and only about 30 minutes slower door to door. Same likely goes for some city pairings on the Acela Express corridor.

People just see a cheap 1 hour flight and assume it's the default way to travel without considering the cost to our planet, let alone the hidden time and money sinks that air travel creates (bag fees, getting there 2 hours early, etc.) compared to alternatives.

However in most areas of the U.S., this is not the case. Amtrak usually takes longer than even driving, and is rampant with multiple hour delays for freight trains, power outages, understocked cafe cars, dirty trains, passengers that weren't acting very safe, and more. I've encountered all of these in just 4 10-hour Amtrak rides.

Even if you are fortunate enough to have the vacation time to regularly travel by train (which in the U.S. job market is unlikely), you are probably going to be traveling on an old diesel train that isn't operating at full capacity. There won't nearly be as much emission savings as in other countries.

And it's not like these are extravagant international trips either. Most of it is work trips, visiting family and friends, or just visiting nature, events, cities, and attractions all within our own country (which we should be doing more of to minimize overtourism impacts). The U.S. just happens to be a large country that requires a 6 hour flight to cross (excluding Hawaii since there's also ethical considerations for vacationing there and trains and large oceans simply aren't the greatest combination).

On a local scale this also goes for public transit in cities. Most transit systems focus on commuters going from the suburbs to downtown and back again. Have a reverse commute, a suburb to suburb commute, night shift work, errands to run during the day, or just want to go to a restaurant, the movies or something else fun after work or on the weekends? Too bad, go get a car. The operating hours and routes won't work for you, and it will take 3 hours to get anywhere. And there's not much security presence either, so you'll probably feel unsafe riding.

How can we help change this for the better? Can we really blame people for not utilizing trains at this point? Should the train really be considered a viable alternative?","climatechange",97,"https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1j9n3yf/should_americans_actually_be_blamed_for_not/"

Was just thinking, especially in the UK, with the need for inertia (turbine-based) carbon-neutral power generation, could the addition of a Sabatier reactor (H2 + CO2 - NG + Water) onto existing NG power plants be a cheap fix to produce power using green hydrogen? 

This is assuming green hydrogen gets to a low enough cost where it would become feasible to burn for electricity.

Just because adding this reactor and rerouting the CO2 capture to add it back into this reactor seems like an easy retrofit, given green hydrogen could be piped to these plants.

&gt;Good data visualizations can help make climate change more visceral and understandable. Back in 2016 Ed Hawkins published a [climate spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_spiral) graph that ended up being pretty iconic  it was shown at the opening ceremony of the Olympics that year  and is probably the second most widely seen climate graph after Hawkins later [climate stripes](https://showyourstripes.info/).  
          
&gt;However, I havent previously come across any versions of the spiral graph showing daily global temperatures, so I thought it would be fun to create my own (with, I should note, a bit of help from OpenAIs o3 model to code it).   
           
&gt;Here are daily global temperatures by year between 1940 (when the ERA5 daily dataset begins) and the end of 2024, with the color varying from blue to red over time.  
              
***   
                 
The article's spiral graph of daily temperatures shows that the first instance during 1940-2024 when the ERA5 global _daily_ mean near-surface (2 meters) air temperature exceeded 1.75ºC above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial global daily mean temperature was in February 2016, but it shows neither the day of the month nor the actual daily temperature anomaly, only that it was more than 1.75 ºC above the 1850-1900 global daily mean temperature corresponding with the unspecified day in February 2016.     
                
Calculations using the ERA5 dataset and equation in the ERA5 **[Relating to 1850-1900  full methodological description](https://climate.copernicus.eu/climate-bulletin-about-data-and-analysis)** show that on February 24, 2016, the daily global mean surface air temperature was 1.77ºC above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial daily mean temperature for February 24, and 4 days later on February 28, the global daily mean surface air temperature peaked at 1.89 ºC above the 1850-1900 global daily mean temperature for February 28.       

Copernicus [Climate Pulse](https://pulse.climate.copernicus.eu) &gt; Air Temperature &gt; Anomalies &gt;  Download Data (CSV) shows that on February 24, 2016, the global daily mean near-surface air temperature was **+0.82 ºC** above the 1991-2020 global daily mean temperature for February 24.          
        
The ERA5 [equation](https://climate.copernicus.eu/climate-bulletin-about-data-and-analysis) in **Reference periods and other time-related definitions** can be used to calculate the ERA5 1850-1900 to 1991-2020 global daily mean surface air temperature offset for every single day in the ERA5 1940-2025 dataset.     
                   
Calculations using the ERA5 equation show that the 1850-1900 to 1991-2020 global daily mean surface air temperature offset for February 24 is **+0.946 ºC**.     
                     
Together, the ERA5 0.82ºC temperature anomaly on February 24, 2016, relative to the 1991-2020 global daily mean surface air temperature, and the ERA5 1850-1900 to 1991-2020 daily global mean surface air temperature offset of +0.946 ºC for February 24, show that the daily global mean near-surface air temperature on February 24, 2016, was **1.766 ºC** above the 1850-1900 daily global mean surface air temperature for February 24.     
       
Calculations using the ERA5 dataset and equation show that February 24, 2016 was the first day when the ERA5 1940-2025 daily global mean surface air temperature exceeded 1.75º C above the 1850-1900 daily global mean  surface air temperature on any day of the year.        
         
Calculations using the ERA5 data and equation show that from January 1, 2025, through March 8, 2025, the _daily_ global mean near-surface air temperatures relative to the 1850-1900 daily global mean near-surface air temperature on each single day has ranged from a high of +1.77 ºC on January 1 to a low of +1.36 ºC on February 16, and +1.65º C on March 8.       
        
Calculations using the ERA data and equation show that the year-to-date January 1March 8, 2025, average of the global daily mean surface air temperatures is 1.63 ºC above the average of the 1850-1900 global daily mean surface air temperatures for January 1March 8.","climatechange",0,"https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1j8d5hz/new_spiral_graph_shows_that_the_era5_19402024/"

\--- TLDR ---  
All ice on the planet is 30 million cubic kilometers.   
The surfce of the oceans is 361 million square kilometers

30/361 (rounded) = 0,1

\-&gt; If all ice melts on the planet, water levels will rise only 0.1m. 

Am I missing something?  
\---- Full Story ---

So i was watching this podcast where sombody said in a side sentence somethig like ""... and the water levels if al ice melts isnt even 10 cm...""

As i sometimes do, i pause the video like: ""shut up... thats not true its above 50m or so... let me look this up"". Down the rabbit hole i go. 

I ask chat GPT and it does the Math wrong and quotes somthing like 65-85 meters. Same on german ""Tagesschau"" but without the calculation. The same with my self hosted AI. Everywhere there is either just the number 60-80 or 65-85 meters but when there is a calculation it is always wrong - as I wrote in the TLDR. 

I keep researching until i find the most official thing I think I can find where I should be able to trust it: European Space agency: 

[https://www.esa.int/Space\_in\_Member\_States/Germany/Klimafaktor\_Eis\_Gigantische\_Schwankungen\_des\_Meeressspiegels](https://www.esa.int/Space_in_Member_States/Germany/Klimafaktor_Eis_Gigantische_Schwankungen_des_Meeressspiegels)

Important Quote (German): ""Würde das im Eis gebundene Wasser von nahezu 30 Mill. Km^(3) völlig abschmelzen, müsste der Meeresspiegel  bezogen auf die heutige Meeresfläche von 361 Mill. Km^(2)  um fast 80 Meter ansteigen.""

English version (Chat GPT Translated, but I verified it): ""If the water bound in the ice, totaling nearly 30 million km³, were to melt completely, the sea level would rise by almost 80 meters, based on today's ocean surface area of 361 million km².""

Again those numbes are again confirmed:   
30 Million cubic kilometers of ice  
361 million square kilometers of surface. 

So those aren'wrong. Im pretty damn sure of it. 

But I cant get to 80 or so meters of watere levels. I even went so far so literally write it down, because I tough my unit is off since the result is in km not meters. But I just cant get to it. So here is my full math, tell me if Im wrong: 

30 million k  m\^3  
361 million k m\^2

Million and k in a division are just zeros, so we can scratch them out: 

30 m\^3  
361 m\^2

30/361 = (rounded) 0,1

m\^3/m\^2 = m

So there is no kilometers remaining, just meters and 0.1. So water levels would rise 0.1m... ?

\---

Every article I find just quotes the 60-85 meter number but I havent found anything I can really use as for how that number is derived or where it comes from other than ""experts"".

We need baseload 24-7 power - solar, wind, and energy efficiency can only get us so far without radically increasing electric rates; batteries are expensive and buy you 2-6 hours, not 10-12 hours at high cost; nuclear isn't happening for at least 10-20 years (and if it does will be supply limited)...natural gas is the only economically feasible option available to us right now.

What about geothermal?  We would love to buy geothermal, but it is a nascent industry.  There is a lot of project development risk in both the technology, transmission access, and financing.

Big geothermal projects are limited and the ones that we (us and multiple other utilities) start discussions with end up ghosting us because they can get more money from California utilities.

But California already has pretty clean electricity per kilowatt-hour.  For the dollars they spend to get to 100% carbon-free, they are paying a lot to reduce a little.

They are sucking away supply-limited geothermal from other more carbon intensive states surrounding them.  For the same dollars they spend to get to the gold standard, other states could reduce 2-3x as much carbon by improving the back and middle of the electric company pack.

They obviously can't subsidize our carbon free power plants (even if it is more carbon and economically efficient) but if they at least stopped buying geothermal, it would lower geothermal project demand and open up supply to the rest of us, lowering project prices and overall emissions.

Batteries are a more decentralized technology that don't have the same geographic and transmission requirements.  California could continue down that path, improving the technology and lowering prices with increased demand and resulting expanded manufacturing (like they did with solar panels) without the same impacts to other utilities...

Food will not be wasted as much and people will be much smarter with their spending habits. 


2. Increased recycling. Companies that used to rely on outsourced and imported materials will now have to rely on domestic recycled materials.

How many centuries after a full switchover to (for example) nuclear energy would we expect to see Earths climate stabilize into a new status quo and what might that look like once it does?  One of my first temptations was to look back at the later Mesozoic Era (maybe the Cretaceous when the continents were closer to their current configuration than at the start?) as a template for a what a fully stabilized world without polar ice caps might look like from a climate standpoint, but is that accurate?  What are the similarities and differences I might expect between this future era and prior warmest periods in Earths history?

Additionally, assuming human civilization either maintains or redevelops technology and continues to refine it after the climate does reach a new stable status quo, can you think of any issues significant enough that they might genetically alter themselves to deal with, that you and I from the modern era might have difficulties with?  For example, would O2 or CO2 amounts be different enough to alter our breathing?  UV reaching the surface?  Increased heatstroke risks in large areas of the world?

Im just wondering this because I think a lot of stories underestimate how long could take our technology to potentially accomplish some science-fiction staples, and by the time it happens it seems realistic we will have undergone a climate shift and possibly seen it start to restabilize in a different form than we know it today.","climatechange",32,"https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1jp8yxi/stabilization_after_the_change_1000_years_into/"

"2025-03-31",1743465531,"What do you think of a way to track your carbon footprint, but coupled with a database of products and activities that has all of the carbon data?","I'm sure there are other carbon tracker platforms that exist, but I think this could be coupled with an ever evolving wiki of carbon footprint data of everyday products and tasks. Over time, the wiki would contain more data and provide more accurate, study-backed, figures. Editable by people, in the same way as Wikipedia, with sources etc.

As data entry is a laborious task, I think a lot of this can be automated with AI, i.e. by taking a picture of the product/activity and having the AI suggest what it thinks you are doing and automatically adding the task to your carbon budget. I've already done a project which tells you the carbon footprint of fruit in real time, as proof of concept, you can see it here: [https://imgur.com/a/t3OCiel](https://imgur.com/a/t3OCiel)

In my previous job I also undertook life cycle carbon footprint studies of our products (construction products) as it was becoming more important in the industry. This involved raw materials, manufacturing, transport and end of life.

My idea would be an app where you take a picture of say your meal or a product that you're buying and it's carbon footprint is auto-populated into your budget. For a task, like using a washing machine, the CO2 impact of that task would be input into the app, say if you're washing at 30C (temperature) for 1hr. This would have to be combined with the wiki where over time users, and companies, would add the carbon footprints of their products / product use so that users can have the data. You can also have other features like detecting when you're travelling and what mode, like how Google Fit currently works.

From my research, we need a global average annual carbon footprint per capita of \~1 tonne CO2 emissions in order to hit the 1.5C limit temperature rise by 2050 of the Paris Climate Agreement. This was based on assumptions of a carbon budget of about 300b tonnes of CO2, about 10b people on the planet and about 30 years to 2050.

My other idea was to make this ""instagrammable"", i.e. make it something that people would want to share and post about online in the same way that people post about their healthy eating habits, meditation or fitness routines. I am sure that there are communities doing this, but I have not really seen it in the mainstream. I was also looking at coupling this with a subreddit or other forums (maybe this subreddit), I've also made r/OneTonneChallenge , where people can share their progress, tips, get inspired or get support.

"2025-03-31",1743435573,"Shower Thought: Future population growth will have minimal impact on CO2 emissions as it will happen in poorly developed areas with low per capita CO2 emissions","Some say we can expect another 1.5 to 2 billion souls to join us on this planet over the next 60-80 years, which is a cause for alarm since we already wildly exceed our CO2 emissions quota.

I've been looking at emissions data recently and had an interesting realization: Most future population growth will be in poorly developed regions of the world with very low per capita CO2 emissions, meaning they will have minimal impact in our future CO2 footprint.

## The Data:

**Nigeria** (Africa's most populous country):

* Per capita CO emissions have remained remarkably stable at [0.5-0.7 tons per person over the past 30 years](https://www.worldometers.info/co2-emissions/nigeria-co2-emissions/)
* Even as the population has grown substantially, per capita emissions haven't increased - in fact, they were higher in the early 1990s (0.69 tons) than in recent years (0.55 tons)

**Kenya** (showing more typical development patterns):

* Per capita emissions have only gradually increased [from ~0.3 tons to ~0.45 tons over decades](https://www.worldometers.info/co2-emissions/kenya-co2-emissions/)
* While total emissions have grown, this is more a function of population growth than increased consumption

For context, these figures are:

* ~1/30th of US per capita emissions
* ~1/15th of EU average emissions
* ~1/20th of China's emissions

## The Bigger Picture:

50% of our future population growth is expected to be in Africa. Looking at data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions), Africa as a whole contributes just 3-4% of global emissions despite having 17-18% of the world's population. The continent's per capita emissions peaked around 1980 at approximately 1.2 tons per person and have actually been declining in recent years to around 0.95-1 ton per person. The expected pattern of growing per capita emissions over time has just not been realized in reality. 

https://i.ibb.co/Ng7dhmBW/image.png

When visualized, Africa's contribution to historical CO emissions is so small it's barely visible on the same scale as global emissions.

https://i.ibb.co/1GcCbqXG/image.png

## Climate Justice Implications:

What makes this particularly unjust is that Africa (17% of the world's population) is projected to suffer disproportionately from climate impacts despite contributing the least to the problem historically (4%):

* Many African nations rely heavily on rain-fed agriculture in regions with increasingly unpredictable precipitation
* High exposure to extreme heat events in already hot climates
* Limited financial resources for adaptation measures
* Food security challenges in regions already facing nutritional issues

## Unrealized Potential:

Despite Africa having some of the world's best solar resources, only 2% of global solar installations are in Africa. This represents both a challenge and an opportunity - with proper investment, African nations could potentially develop with much lower emissions intensity than historical patterns would suggest.

## Conclusion:

There is no climate population time bomb - reducing per capita CO2 emissions in the developed world (USA, Europe, China) is much more impactful than reducing population growth in Africa","climatechange",40,"https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1jo65qy/shower_thought_future_population_growth_will_have/"

Put another way, why wouldnt the GWP20 of Sevoflurane be 0 if the lifetime is truly 1.4-2yrs in the atmosphere? If the GWP500 of Sevoflurane is 43 (per what I can find online) how is it short lived in terms of warming potential? 

I do understand principles of exponential decay so it might be that the lifetime refers to when some fraction remains? 

Thanks in advance for anyone who can help. ","climatechange",11,"https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1jm9lih/technical_question_gwp_and_atmospheric_lifetime/"

I dont see how we can tackle climate change without either taking extremely drastic and ethically horrific measures or being so slow and methodical that we use up time we may not have.

If we try to solve the problem while clinging to our quality of life, wealth, and freedoms such as the right to travel, drive, eat what we want, and consume as we please, progress may be far too slow. But I cant see any alternative that doesnt involve questionable and morally fraught actions, whether that means drastically lowering the global standard of living (which in many places is already poor) for a long time, or massively reducing the population or its growth, both of which are dangerous and obviously unethical.

And if we take the drastic route, who would be in charge of enforcing it? It certainly wouldnt be the general public, since people are not going to vote to have their way of life destroyed and their living standards reduced to those of the 1600s. It would have to be driven by wealthy elites, politicians, and non-government organizations imposing their vision on the world without democratic consent.

The ethical problems with this are enormous. Who gets to decide what sacrifices are made? And are the people in power even ethical or competent enough to wield such influence responsibly?

Would the elites imposing these measures make the same sacrifices, or would they continue living in luxury while forcing the masses to bear the brunt of the changes?

Could governments exploit the climate crisis to justify authoritarian control, using it as a pretext for surveillance, restrictions, and population control?","climatechange",226,"https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1jlvetw/the_fundamental_challenge_in_facing_climate/"

I got some really thoughtful responses that helped give me the push to get it out into the world. So, I finally decided to launch it.

Its called **How to Fix Our Broken World**, and the first four chapters are now live and free to read online. (More chapters are coming as I finish them.) 

It builds toward a full climate action plan for Canada, but most of the ideas can apply more broadly.

This isnt a book about how bad things are. We know it's bad. Its about what we can actually *do*, including:

* Reforestation and carbon removal
* Nuclear, geothermal, and hydrogen energy
* Carbon capture, ocean cleanup, sustainable agriculture
* A data-backed climate plan that could *pay for itself* over time

Its been a 5-year passion project so far, written whenever I've had time outside of a full-time job and being a dad. Id love any feedback, questions, critiques, or shares if you think its worth it. 

Theres also a newsletter signup if you want to follow along. I'm especially looking for folks who are up for reading chapters and giving honest feedback as I go.

Edit: I'm specifically referring to the ecological crisis. Maybe I'm thinking it wrong, but I've always seen two crises deeply connected.

The other is the ecological crisis (we are in the sixth mass extinction).

Uranium reactions persist at high power for weeks after shutdown so natural disasters can cause steam explosions by cutting coolant. Uranium plants cant be built in geologically active areas and no safe storage area has been found yet for spent fuel. Spent thorium fuel requires cooling for a much shorterter period and remains highly radioactive for several hundred years. Thorium reserves are estimated to be 6.4 million tons and estimated 4 times more than uranium. Possibly enough to last 1,000 years. Thorium is not naturally radioactive like uranium. Thorium must be exposed to neutrons using a particle accelerator and a lead target or other nutron source. About 95% splits releasing about the same energy as conventional uranium nuclear reactor. Molten salt is used to transfer heat to power a steam turbine, which eliminates risk of steam explosions. The difference is that when the particle accelerator turns off the thirium reactor turns off. Uranium does not. This means ADSR thorium reactors can be built where uranium reactors cannot.

Often backed by large advertising budgets, a new breed of climate denial is gaining popularity.""","&gt;Gone are the days when Global warming isnt real was the primary claim of those most vocally opposed to climate action. As more people experience the firsthand effects of climate-change-juiced-up heat waves, hurricanes, wildfires, and crop failures, a new kind of climate denial has emerged. Rather than outright deny the problem, today, the most popular online influencers focus on other false or misleading messages like Climate solutions dont work, Climate change has some benefits, and pollution reduction policies are tools for governments to control people.

&gt;These new forms of denial made up 70% of all such claims on YouTube in 2023, up from 35% in 2018, [according to the Center for Countering Digital Hate](https://counterhate.com/blog/the-new-climate-denial-major-new-report-on-youtube-uncovers-evolution-of-climate-deniers-tactics/)....

&gt;Of the 10 most popular online shows, eight have spread false or misleading information about climate change, a Yale Climate Connections analysis found. That analysis builds on recent [work by Media Matters for America](https://www.mediamatters.org/google/right-dominates-online-media-ecosystem-seeping-sports-comedy-and-other-supposedly), a journalism watchdog organization, which found that right-leaning influencers now dominate digital media like podcasts and streams.

Trump administration officials are contributing to the climate change denial rhetoric, according to the article:

&gt;New denial talking points have also become common among members of the new Trump Administration. Energy Secretary Chris Wright told [Fox Business](https://heated.world/p/trump-energy-chief-says-there-are) that Theres pluses to global warming. And [EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-launches-biggest-deregulatory-action-us-history), We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion. 

EDIT:  EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has announced the EPA will undertake a ""formal reconsideration"" of the EPA's key 2009 ""endangerment finding"" which has formed the basis of EPA efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions.  See my comment in the following thread.

This report stresses the importance of limiting warming to no more than a total of 2.0 deg C, or ideally 1.5 deg C, due to dangerous effects on natural and human systems. This all makes sense to me.

What I'm unclear on is how the IPCC determined what they consider ""dangerous"". Was there some initial period of thinking where the group of researchers decided what types of detrimental changes were unacceptable, and then did they back into the 1.5/2.0 C targets because that was the threshold at which those unacceptable changes would appear? Or was the 1.5/2.0 target just some kind of subjective target?

I haven't been able to find much on this element of the research process and would like to learn more.

According to that second calculator, my household produces 47 tons per year. In total last year, the US produced about 16 tons of carbon per citizen, which means my household, which produced (47 tons / 5 people) 9.4 tons of carbon per resident is almost twice as green than the national average. To completely wipe out our carbon footprint, given the average American lives 80 years and a white oak absorbs an average of .1 tons of CO2 per year and lives \~250 years (25 total tons per tree), we each need to plant ((9.4 \* 80) / 25) about 30 white oaks to offset our individual carbon footprint. 

 

To me, this sounds like we need a government organization that lets people enroll to plant a certain amount of trees, say each member works 12 hours per month (or 144 hours per year), and every tree takes (let's make it time inefficient and easy to calculate) 30 minutes to plant, we would have about 288 trees per year per member. If the government really wanted to solve climate change, they could offer military equivalent benefits to every citizen who verifiably participates in this program for a certain number of years, let's say 10 because out deficit is already plenty large, and we don't need it too much higher. Assuming only 1% of the population goes into this program, we will be planting 1 billion trees per year, offsetting our carbon output by about 100 million tons per year.  Or if 10% of the population joined, 1 billion tons of CO2 per year. Back to the 1% example, the number of trees would be 1 billion n every year, and every tree planted will be absorbing carbon for another 250 years, so there will be 100 million n tons of carbon being absorbed every year by the program. By the 10th year, the US would be carbon neutral. by the 30th year, the US would be covering more than the carbon of both us and China.","climatechange",231,"https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1k42glx/accidentally_solved_climate_change_for_a_school/"

I live in central Spain which is typically a two-season climate, which a long, hot summer and a moderate winter where it can freeze, but does not always. Winter this year was pretty typical. 

Spring though, has been way off. 

March saw 920% our average rainfall. You may have heard of the terribly destructive flooding in Valencia. That's not us. The huge rain dump here has been distributed over more time and thus had no more negative impact than typical inconvenience, but it's turned the moderate green areas downright lush. 

Our current temperatures are three degrees Celsius below seasonal average. Not only is it not warm, it's actually cold and windy. 

All this is quite beneficial to us in the short term, as the extra groundwater and plant growth will be a bulwark against summer heat, especially after last year's terrible droughts, but the extreme abnormality of it worries me as it should worry anybody. Climate change doesn't mean your year-round weather will trend in the same direction of change. Extreme swings are harbingers of other, opposing swings in the future.

There are some amazing food statistics from Our World in Data that show how unfair and unsustainable the current food system is.

# LAND STATISTICS

Deserts and ice cover a quarter of ALL land, leaving three quarters as habitable.We use 44% of that habitable land for agriculture! Nearly half. It is equal to about 5 TIMES the size of the United States! Yet here is the really UNFAIR bit. The way it breaks down, over 80% of this farmland feeds the rich. We get most of the livestock meat and dairy.  But the rich are a really small fraction of the world's population! As Our World in Data shows, Meat, dairy, and farmed fish provide just 17% of the worlds calories and 38% of its protein. (This includes crops like soy bean that are fed to cattle.)  
[https://ourworldindata.org/global-land-for-agriculture](https://ourworldindata.org/global-land-for-agriculture)

# THE POOR

The rest of the human race is mainly vegetarian, and are fed by 1 USA worth of land. The rich consume 4 USA's worth of land in livestock production - but this only feeds 17% of humanity's calories and just over a third of our protein.

Scientists have found natural cultures out in the environment which can be brewed up using renewable energy. Solar power captures 4 TIMES the sunlight of photosynthesis. The whole process is 10 TIMES more land efficient than even soy beans! [https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2015025118](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2015025118)

But unlike soy beans, solar panels can be put on rooftops and in deserts and even floated on fresh water reservoirs (which could save precious fresh water from evaporation.) Futurist Tony Seba predicts 'Precision Fermentation' could scale up and bring costs down to the point where it bankrupt meat and dairy farming.  If we assume this - then we could return 4 United States worth of land to natural ecosystems.

This would soak up so much CO2 it could potentially store 332547	Gt CO2

ASSUMING we can clean up our energy and land use and ***actually reach*** net zero by 2060 - what temperature reduction would this range give the world?

Siberian traps, formed as a result of eruptions of the Siberian plume 250 (two hundred and fifty) million years ago, caused a global catastrophe and the great Permian extinction.

Now scientists predict a repeat of this catastrophe in the coming years. 

But as it turns out, there is now a solution that can prevent this catastrophe. 
To reduce the excess pressure in the Earth's interior, which is the cause of increasing natural disasters and activation of the Siberian plume requires a large-scale and serious controlled degassing. Such an operation can be safely carried out in the area of the Siberian plume, because there are Siberian traps there. These traps are frozen lava flows that act as armatures holding the Earth's crust together. They allow the pressure to be released gradually without the risk of a catastrophic explosion and tectonic plate rupture.

Yet, as explained below, research validating the accuracy of climate change models perhaps may now be verboten (""forbidden, especially by an authority"").

&gt;Climate scientists do not have crystal balls. But they do have climate models that provide remarkably accurate projections of global warming  and have done so for decades.

&gt;[Zeke Hausfather](https://berkeleyearth.org/team/#zeke-hausfather) is a research scientist at Berkeley Earth. He [looked at](https://eps.harvard.edu/files/eps/files/hausfather_2020_evaluating_historical_gmst_projections.pdf) climate models dating back to the 1970s and evaluated their predictions for how increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would affect global temperatures.

&gt;Hausfather: A lot of those early models ended up proving quite prescient in terms of predicting what would actually happen in the real world in the years after they were published. & Of the 17 we looked at, 14 of them were pretty much spot-on.

[https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2025/04/computer-models-have-been-accurately-predicting-climate-change-for-50-years/](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2025/04/computer-models-have-been-accurately-predicting-climate-change-for-50-years/)

&gt;And he says todays [climate models](https://climate.mit.edu/explainers/climate-models) are far more advanced.

&gt;They incorporate vast quantities of data about land cover, air circulation patterns, Earths rotation, and carbon pollution to create localized projections for heat, precipitation, and sea level rise.

&gt;And they simulate a range of scenarios.

&gt;Hausfather:  & that reflect a wide range of possible futures, you know, a world where we rapidly cut emissions, a world where we rapidly increase emissions and everything in between.

&gt;So the models provide reliable projections based on each scenario & but which outcome becomes reality will depend on the steps that people take to reduce carbon pollution and limit climate change.

&gt;While there is [growing evidence](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/13/opinion/climate-change-excessive-heat-2023.html) that the rate of warming has increased in recent decades compared to what weve experienced since the 1970s, this acceleration is largely included in our climate models, which show around 40% faster warming in the period between 2015 and 2030 compared to 1970-2014.

&gt;EPA administrator Lee Zeldin [announced](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/trump-epa-kicks-formal-reconsideration-endangerment-finding-agency-partners) Wednesday that the agency will undertake a formal reconsideration of its 2009 endangerment finding, which underpins the agencys legal obligation to regulate carbon dioxide and other climate pollutants under the Clean Air Act. The EPA also announced that it intends to undo all of its prior rules that flow from that finding, including limits on emissions from automobiles and power plants alongside scores of other rules pertaining to air and water pollution.  

&gt;Today is the greatest day of deregulation our nation has seen. We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the **climate change religion**, \[BF added\] Zeldin [said](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-launches-biggest-deregulatory-action-us-history).

EDIT 2:  EDIT 1 omitted this quoted material from the immediately above OP:

Released in 2009, the EPA's endangerment finding has been considered the ""holy grail"" of climate change regulation, and Trump's EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has announced an attempt to dismantle it.

&gt;The agency at the center of federal climate action said it would roll back bedrock scientific findings, kill climate rules, terminate grants that are already under contract, and change how it collects and uses greenhouse gas data. Taken together, the plans would effectively remove EPA from addressing climate change at a time when global temperatures have soared to heights never experienced by humans.

EDIT 3:  In response to an excellent comment by Molire, clicked on the ""looked at"" link again 14 hours after the original post.  Now the following research letter is provided!

&gt;We find that climate models published over the past five decades were generally quite accurate in predicting global warming in the years after publication, particularly when accounting for differences between modeled and actual changes in atmospheric CO 2 and other climate drivers. This research should help resolve public confusion around the performance of past climate modeling efforts and increases our confidence that models are accurately projecting global warming.

"2025-04-09",1744212438,"The Year Denver Runs Out of Breath","# Denver, the city of sunshine and powder, has always been a place that sold itself on the crispness of its air. The kind of air you could bottle and sell to New Yorkers. The kind that made skiers grin and runners fly. But that air is vanishing. Not invisibly, not quietly. It's being burned, smoked, and baked away.

We are on track to turn Denver into a city of filtered lungs and endless summers. Not the sort of eternal summer that Californians fantasize aboutbut the kind where the asphalt cooks your shoes, the sky takes on a beige smear from wildfires, and hospitals overflow with people whose hearts and lungs just cant take it anymore.

By 2075, if we continue on the path were onthe one driven by a high-emissions scenario known as SSP5-8.5Denver could be more than **8°F warmer** than it was at the start of the 21st century (IPCC AR6, 2021). Thats not a statistic. Thats your grandmother's porch melting. Thats your kids staying indoors for weeks because the air is too thick to breathe.

You think you know summer in Denver? Try sixty days above 100°F. Try air quality alerts not for a day or two, but for entire months. A smoke season that lasts longer than ski season. Welcome to the future we are barreling toward, fueled by apathy and inertia.

**Smoke Season is the Fifth Season Now**

The smoke isnt a gentle reminder that fires exist in the mountains. Its a suffocating, fine-particle fog that sneaks into nurseries and nursing homes. Already, wildfire smoke accounts for more than half of all fine particulate pollution in the West (O'Dell et al., 2020). And when it combines with ground-level ozonea pollutant that thrives in heatthe effect on lungs, especially in kids and the elderly, becomes something out of a public health horror film (Front Range Air Quality Technical Advisory Panel, 2022).

A 2023 study from NOAA found that Denver's ozone pollution will likely **increase in severity and duration** as summers heat up (Fiore et al., 2023). That's because ozone is formed when sunlight hits emissions from cars and factories. More sun. More heat. More ozone. Think of it as a perverse kind of solar powerone that powers lung disease.

By mid-century, Denverites could experience 40 to 80 days of dangerous air quality each year, depending on how fast or slow we act now (Colorado Climate Center, 2022). In the worst-case path, youd need a mask just to walk your dog, not for a virus but for the sky.

**Water: The Last Argument of a Thirsty City**

Denver was never a rainforest, but by 2075 it may come to resemble a high-altitude Phoenix. The snow that feeds the citys water supply is melting earlier every year. The rivers run shallow by August. Springs come too soon. Summers stretch into October. Evaporation steals more water than we can save.

Climate scientists call it **increased atmospheric evaporative demand** (McEvoy et al., 2020). Thats a Masters-level way of saying the sky is thirstier now. It drinks the moisture from soil, trees, rivers, even your skin. In a high-warming scenario, Colorado River flows could drop by **up to 30% by 2050** (Udall &amp; Overpeck, 2017). Denver drinks from that river. So does Phoenix. So does Las Vegas. So does Los Angeles. The math doesnt work.

**The City That Sold a Climate Mirage**

Real estate brochures wont mention the 110°F summers, the smoke-thick skies, or the fact that your homeowners insurance might double because of fire and flood risk. Theyll sell you sunshine, mountain views, and walkability. But walk where, exactly? Through triple-digit heat and asthma-level air quality? This is not a livable climate.

And yet, we continue to build. The cranes keep swinging, the suburbs keep expanding, and lawns still gleam under the punishing sun. We are terraforming the Front Range for a climate that no longer exists.

**We Know What Works. We Just Dont Do It.**

The good news? We know exactly how to stop this. If the world were to aggressively cut emissions starting now (SSP1-2.6), Denver might warm by only 23°F total by 2075. Wed still have fires and droughts, but theyd be manageable. The air might still burn some days, but not every week. Our rivers might run low, but not dry. Kids could still play outside.

Denver has begun doing some of this workelectrifying buses, promoting water-wise landscaping, building energy-efficient homes. But its not nearly enough. Not when 60% of the regions emissions still come from fossil fuels and vehicle miles traveled keep rising (DRCOG, 2022).

**The Case for Panic**

Maybe panic is appropriate. Not the kind that paralyzes, but the kind that sparks revolution. The kind that leads to tree-planting programs in every neighborhood, to banning gas-powered lawn tools, to shifting water laws so every drop counts. The kind that gets us off the couch, out of denial, and into climate action.

Because in 2075, when your grandkids ask what summer used to smell like, you dont want to say: *Smoke.*

You want to say: *Pine needles. Rain on hot pavement. The air after a thunderstorm.* You want to say you remembered what mattered in time.



IMO there are three main talking points about AI, harming the environment:

- Energy consumption
- Carbon footprint and Greenhouse gases (GHG) in general
- Water scarcity and pollution

I sorted sources about negative impacts at the top of each section and about negative impact - on the bottom.

## 1. Energy consumption

As of 2024, [Data centers accounted for about 1.5% of global electricity consumption, with AI accounted for 15% of total data centre energy demand accordingly.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ai-will-drive-doubling-of-data-center-energy-demand-by-2030/) Therefore we can say that AI itself is using around 0.225% of global energy reserves.

[Predicted share of energy usage for data centers by 2030 is between 5 and 20%.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ai-will-drive-doubling-of-data-center-energy-demand-by-2030/) Considering that AI it still on it's growth and can take over up to 50% of all data center's resources, in 2030 it can be responsible for 2.5 up to 10% of all energy consumption (20 up to 90 times more, than of now) which is quite radical, but not unrealistic prediction.

Nevertheless, as of right now, [ML-related technologies is able to provide 15% improvement in grid efficiency and 1020% increase in battery storage efficiency](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/15/10/1250) and [2030% relative efficiency gains in cell and module R&amp;D.](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0958305X241256293)
Same magnitude of efficiency gains is also the case for all clean and non-clean energy sources, by forecasting the weather and autoadjusting solar panels, micromanaging power grids and plants, predicting deposits of fossil energy sources and so on. 

I think safe to say, that estimated energy gain overall will equal to or most likely surpass even the most pessimistic prognosis of 10% energy consumption from AI alone by 2030.



## 2. Carbon footprint and GHG in general

According to [ICEF report from November 2024](https://www.icef.go.jp/wp-content/themes/icef/pdf/2024/roadmap/15_ICEF2.0%20GHG%20Emissions%20from%20AI_stand%20alone.pdf), (This link will download PDF file!) AIs total GHG emissions are estimated at 100300 million tonnes CO2, or roughly 0.2-0.6% of global emissions. With that, operational emissions are around 0.05% while manufacturing servers, chips, facilities, model trainings and life-cycle impacts make up the remainder.

At the same time AI can [reduce global GHG emissions by 510% by 2030](https://thesustainableagency.com/blog/environmental-impact-of-generative-ai/), via optimized grids, predictive maintenance, and smart agriculture and, additionally, [cuts of up to 5.3 gigatons CO2 (another 510% of current emissions)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S277242712200122X) - through applications in transport, buildings, and supply chains.

[One specific research](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97110-3) (from month ago) from China indicates, that correlation between % of AI adoption and % of reducing carbon footprint (1% and 0.0395% accordingly) is quite sustainable and universal across the industries. But hard to say of this correlation will hold with future increasing AIfication of industries.



## 3. Water scarcity and pollution

[Apparently in US AI is responsible for 0.5-0.7% of total annual water withdrawal](https://oecd.ai/en/wonk/how-much-water-does-ai-consume). If source took a data of water consumptions by data centers in general (it most likely the case, as most of the articles do so), then actual numbers will be a 15% of 0.5-0.7%, which is 0.075-0.105% accordingly.

Considering that most of the world AI infrastructure is located in US and China, safe to say, that for the rest of the world this percentages is significantly smaller.

The real concern, however, is the water pollution and separate cases of mismanagement from the corporations. [Quote: ""Googles planned data centre in Uruguay, which recently suffered its worst drought in 74 years, would require 7.6 million litres per day, sparking widespread protest.""](https://sdgs.un.org/sites/default/files/2024-05/Gupta%2C%20et%20al._AIs%20excessive%20water%20consumption.pdf)
(This link will download PDF file!)

[Recent article from Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/06/elon-musk-xai-memphis-gas-turbines-air-pollution-permits-00317582) about air pollution from xAI data center is also seems to me as a fair critique.

Here is a positive aspects:

[AI irrigation can reduce water usage by 30-50% while increasing yields by 2030% (which is 58% savings of global agricultural withdrawals if deployed worldwide).](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772375525002151)

[AI acoustic and pressure-based leak detection is already working and have 8097% accuracy, cutting non-revenue water losses by 2040%. Given that networks lose ~30% of supply globally (the most distant and arid places usually suffer the most), AI is saving 612% of treated water.
](https://www.waterrf.org/serve-file/2024_IWS-Challenge-Solution_Case-Western-CWD.pdf)
(This link will download PDF file!)

Same goes for demand forecasting, pump optimization, water quality assessment and many other projects, totaling up to 12% of the saved fresh water worldwide (if implemented worldwide as well, which is not the case for now). Some of this solutions is already implemented and working, although mostly in the water hungriest areas, like parts of Africa, China and India.

I think it's crucial to point out, that most of the water scarcity-related suffering is mostly occurring far from data centers and their water sources. And this problem is more of a logistical one (how to transport the water to the arid areas), than of sheer amount of fresh water world supplies.

I want to highlight, that AI still have an impact on environment and it's a right thing to strife for reducing the environmental impact in any area. But I believe that misinformation, toxicity and alarmism eventually will harm the both sides of this debates.","climatechange",7,"https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1kk3ui4/ai_might_be_a_net_positive_for_the_environment/"

Theres a lot of discourse in liberal media spaces lately about how bad ChatGPT and AI are for the environmenthow using them contributes to high energy use, and how coal and gas plants are being brought back online to meet demand. But doesnt that miss the deeper issue? That responserelying on fossil fuelsis just one path forward, and its being pushed largely by fossil fuel companies and the current administration.

If this is currently the case, how does an increase of the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere would augment the amount of energy kept in the atmosphere, since the graphs reads like the CO2 is already holding in all the energy related to that portion of the spectrum ?

Like ""oh we are not doing enough"" or whatever.

But why aren't we celebrating what has already been done?

Let's not forget that just 50 years ago rivers would catch fire (see [Cuyahoga River Fire](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/cuyahoga-river-caught-fire-least-dozen-times-no-one-cared-until-1969-180972444/), and it was a perfectly normal occurence too). Smog was everywhere in the cities. Coal plants released a lot of soot into the atmosphere.

Let's not forget that 20 years ago, at the turn of the millenium, scientists were predicting that the temperature would rise 4-5 degrees by 2100. Like think about this. Does this seem absurd to you? Now we got people complaining about getting to 2 degrees above pre industrial levels by 2100 which is not good but mind you probably won't happen anyways.

Let's not forget that just 10 years ago we were talking about how solar panels will never be economically viable and will only be for environmentalists. That electrical vehicles had too many shortfalls to be used by everyday people for everyday uses. That coal will still be used for the coming future (now granted it's replacement natural gas isn't exactly better but at least it doesn't create smog).

We are changing. And we are changing fast. EV adoption is at record highs, especially in China. When I went there before covid (Feb 2019) you'd be lucky to find an EV car that wasn't a taxi or a bus. I would say maybe only 1 in 20 or so (very very vague guess) were EVs. Now? The roads are a lot quieter (visited again in Mar 2025). The air is a lot cleaner. The infamous chinese smog? Gone. Just gone. And this has barely been a few years. The increasing economic viability of EVs has also made them appeal to many developing countries such as Mexico and Brazil. We are transitioning to solar energy at record speeds. Even Saudi Arabia, of all countries, is making huge leaps towards renewables (now granted whether or not they achieve that is another mystery).

Over half of Europe's energy is already renewable. China is adopting renewable energy at record speeds too with its solar adoption having increased by 1000x since the economic crisis (when the country started caring about solar). California is leading the country with green energy with over half of our energy being from renewables too. It is pretty common to see solar roofs everywhere. Even red states like Texas is adopting wind energy at record speeds. Everywhere around the world we are adopting renewables. Fast.

The fight is still ongoing. We have not defeated it. But the enemy is a mere shadow of what it once was. Self-combusting rivers are no longer a thing. Leaded gasoline aren't in road vehicles anymore. The ozone layer is rapidly recovering after CFCs got banned. Most of the bad stuff in our atmosphere half a century ago is gone. Knowledge of climate change is higher than it has ever been. CO2 emissions have finally plateaued and peaked in 2024. Renewable adoption is happening at speeds we could have never imagined just a few years ago and it is showing zero signs of slowing down.

Maybe we should just stop. Take a breather. And look at everything around us. It isn't as bad as we would like to believe.","climatechange",73,"https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1khjgbo/why_arent_we_celebrating_progress_on_climate/"

&gt;  
For me, it was the climate crisis  and how little we're factoring its long-term effects into our economic planning  that first triggered my retirement panic. Back in 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projected 2040  the year I turn 60  as the moment the world will likely warm by 1.5 degrees Celsius, the threshold at which the effects of global warming will become irreversibly catastrophic. The following summer, I caught a panel during London's Climate Week that shook me even more. Economists who advise major insurance companies and pension funds presented findings from a model about what climate change will do to the world economy. At the highest projected temperatures, they estimated, GDPs would plummet by 30% by 2080 in every country they modeled, including the United States.

&gt;After the panel, I asked one of the presenters, Willemijn Verdegaal, what I should do to prepare for retirement, assuming the Earth stays on its current warming trajectory.

Theres a lot of confusion online about Jevons Paradox  especially when its used to argue that making renewables cheaper somehow *keeps fossil fuels alive*. Thats not what the paradox says. Lets clear this up.

---

###  **What is Jevons Paradox?**

Jevons Paradox comes from 19th-century economist William Stanley Jevons. He observed that **as steam engines became more efficient**, they made coal-powered energy cheaper  and total **coal consumption increased**, not decreased.

**In short:**  
&gt; *Making a resource cheaper or more efficient to use can lead to *more* demand for that same resource.*

Example:
- In the 1800s, **more efficient steam engines** made coal more useful. This led to an explosion in coal use and **displaced older tech like waterwheels** and manual labor.

---

### **What Jevons Paradox is *not***:

Its not a law that says efficiency always backfires.  
Its not a reason why fossil fuels will persist forever.  
And crucially, it **does not apply** when one energy source **replaces** another  thats called **substitution**, not Jevons.

---

###  **Substitution is not Jevons**

Lets look at some examples of substitution  cases where *new* energy or transport technologies displaced *older* ones:

-  **Cheap fracked natural gas** in the U.S. displaced coal in electricity generation. Gas was cheaper and cleaner, so coal plants shut down. Thats **not** Jevons  thats substitution.
-  **Cheap automobiles** replaced horses. Nobody said, cars got so cheap that we started breeding more horses.
-  **Electric lighting** replaced gas lamps and candles. We didnt suddenly consume more whale oil because LEDs got cheaper.
-  **Cheap solar and wind** are now displacing coal and increasingly gas, because theyre becoming the cheapest sources of electricity in many markets.

If Jevons Paradox applied in these cases, wed see *more* of the old resource being used. But we dont  we see it being pushed out.

---

### **So what *is* happening with energy today?**

Yes, total electricity demand is rising  from EVs, heat pumps, data centers, and development. Thats true. But that doesnt *require* fossil fuels to grow. It just means **we need more energy**  and the cheapest sources will win.

If fossil fuels arent being phased out quickly enough, the reasons are:

- Political lobbying and regulatory capture
- Market inertia and grid bottlenecks
- Subsidies that favor incumbents

Those are real problems  but theyre not Jevons Paradox.

---

###  **Bottom Line**

Jevons Paradox says that making a *resource* more efficient can increase its use.  
It **does not** say that switching to a new, cheaper energy source will keep the old one alive.  
In fact, history shows the opposite: **the cheaper resource usually wins**  and pushes the old one out.

---

**TL;DR**:  
Cheaper solar ` more coal.  
Cheaper gas ` more coal.  
Cheaper cars ` more horses.  
Lets stop misusing Jevons Paradox to justify defeatism about the energy transition.","climatechange",31,"https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1kda74q/jevons_paradox_what_it_is_and_what_its_not/"

To demonstrate my problem, here's a comparison of 17 online carbon/emissions calculators (all free and don't require sign-up) **for the exact same flight**:

  
So I guess my main question is: **why are they all so different??** And which one, if any, should I regard as more ""**accurate**""? The UN's own aviation agency says 0.67 tons, but a local group specifically focused on carbon emissions says 4.24 tons! That's such a big difference that it's hard to know which tool/s to trust...

I was hoping to compare this route with a few different routes from Australia to Europe, to see how much of a difference it makes for one's overall emissions to cut the flights shorter and travel overland part of the way (e.g. flying Perth-Dubai-Eastern Turkey and overland onwards; or flying Darwin-Singapore + overland Singapore-Bangkok + flying Bangkok-Kolkata + overland Kolkata-Delhi + flying Delhi-Istanbul). 

I am very much aware that the least emissions-intensive option is to not travel at all (or do so as infrequently as possible), followed by chartering a sailboat halfway around the world. I am asking this question with the acknowledgement that at least some people in Australia will have at least some seemingly important reasons to travel between these continents.

Texans can save hundreds of dollars each year by switching to heat pumps

&gt;[Steve Nadel](https://www.aceee.org/about/aceee-staff/steven-nadel) is with the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy.

&gt;His group analyzed how much money and energy could be saved if Texas homes that currently use central AC and electric resistance heating were to switch to electric heat pumps when they next replace their systems.

&gt;Heat pumps provide both heat and cooling. They cost a bit more up front, but theyre very efficient. So Nadel [found](https://www.aceee.org/white-paper/2024/11/transforming-texas-how-heat-pumps-can-replace-electric-resistance-heat) that making the switch would save homeowners more than $300 a year on average and thousands over the life of the system.

&gt;Nadel: This is an enormous return on investment.

[Texans can save hundreds of dollars each year by switching to heat pumps » Yale Climate Connections](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2025/04/texans-can-save-hundreds-of-dollars-each-year-by-switching-to-heat-pumps/)

Reading Nadel's original article, the savings may only apply to central HVAC systems using electric resistance coils to heat homes.

&gt;Over 25% of Texas households are heated and cooled by central air-conditioning systems with electric resistance coils that distribute warm air via ducts and registers. These systems are a major contributor to winter peak electric demand. While power demand in Texas generally peaks on hot summer days, winter peaks during cold fronts can be just as large. 

&gt;Heat pumps are a cost-effective alternative to electric resistance heat: they cut energy use, energy bills, and peak demand roughly in half. Homes and apartments can be upgraded with high-efficiency heat pumps when the existing central air-conditioning unit and heating coils need replacement.

[Transforming Texas: How Heat Pumps Can Replace Electric Resistance Heat, Reducing Costs and Winter Power Peaks | ACEEE](https://www.aceee.org/white-paper/2024/11/transforming-texas-how-heat-pumps-can-replace-electric-resistance-heat)

Why do so many Texas homes use electric resistance coils for heating instead of natural gas combustion systems? Are they cheaper?

Any problems with Nadal's analysis?

If accurate, why don't more Texans switch to heat pumps?

With Trump tariffs, will the price of heat pumps soar?

Are heat pumps for residential HVAC systems in Texas more economical if natural gas combustion furnaces are used for heating?

\*\*\*\*\*

I was surprised that over 25 percent of Texas homes are heated by systems using electric resistance coils rather than natural gas furnaces.  So I was curious about that, but also thought, if true, the article could save many Texans considerable money.  It seemed like an extremely worthwhile post.

When I expressed surprise at the deletion and asked for an explanation, a mod responded:  ""It reads an awful lot like a sales pitch to me.""

I replied: ""What? It was an article from Yale Climate Connections that should be very worthwhile to many Texas residents. I also had questions about electric resistance central heating, which I never knew existed. NO FIRMS WERE EVEN MENTIONED IN THE ARTICLE, so how was it a sale pitch???

Do other moderators agree with this strange excuse for removing such a worthwhile article from a highly respected climate news source??? BTW, do you have some connection to the Texas fossil fuel industry? I can't believe an imagined sales pitch was the real reason for removal.""

The mod politely responded:  ""No offense, but it read like an ad to me.""

Actually, I had a different thought about why the post was removed.  Several times in recent years, I had very localized posts about hurricane warnings deleted from a few Florida subs.  When I asked why, I would receive explanations such as my post was ""redundant,"" even though it had extremely worthwhile detailed information not posted on the sub.  All of these deleted posts cited info from the excellent hurricane/storm experts such as Jeff Masters and Bob Henson of Yale Climate Connections.

My belief now is that mods don't want  posts citing Yale Climate Connections material because they don't want sub members exposed to the existence of Yale Climate Connections given its emphasis on climate change, so likely politically motivated deletions given the extreme levels of climate change denial in states such as Florida and Texas.

In other state and local subs, mods don't want climate change discussed because, like health issues, it isn't deemed a locally specific subject.

So perhaps residents of individual states who are concerned about climate change could do much good by creating a climate change sub for their state.

Have other posters experienced deletions of posts discussing climate change in local subs?  Am I imagining it, or are posts from [yaleclimateconnections.com](http://yaleclimateconnections.com) effectively banned in some state subs even when the post doesn't directly discuss climate change, such as my r/Texas post about the cost savings of switching to heat pumps in Texas?

Trump's NIH is deleting existing reports about the climate change health impacts.

&gt;In a [report from December](https://web.archive.org/web/20250117222049/https://climateandhealth.nih.gov/files/2024-12/2024-annual-report-nih-cchi.pdf), the NIH listed numerous ongoing climate change and health projects that it was funding, including research to examine the health impacts of the Maui wildfires in Hawaii, develop models to predict dengue virus transmission by mosquitos, and study the effect of heat on fertility and reproductive functions. The Trump administration has since pulled the [report offline](https://climateandhealth.nih.gov/files/2024-12/2024-annual-report-nih-cchi.pdf).

Wildfires obviously are a mounting health risk, especially due to heightened exposure to fine particulate air pollutants.  Wearing N-95 masks outdoors and using home air filtration would seem advisable when fine particulate air pollutants are high.

By Adam Himmelsbach

When the Celtics lost Game 7 of the 2023 Eastern Conference finals to the Heat, first-year coach Joe Mazzulla was at a low point. But he believed that to truly chase greatness, he needed to be crushed.

He was texting about it with Josh Waitzkin, a former child chess prodigy whose story was chronicled in the 1993 Oscar-nominated film Searching for Bobby Fischer.

He was pissed, Waitzkin said. He also knew it was time to take himself on.

The two had grown close that season after Waitzkin conducted a performance psychology seminar for the Celtics coaching staff. Now, even though they had never met in person, Waitzkin urged Mazzulla to visit his home tucked away in a Costa Rican jungle, where they would tear Mazzulla down in order to build him back up.

He wanted Mazzulla to walk barefoot on mountains amid dangerous wildlife. He wanted Mazzulla to be tossed around by the Pacific Ocean.He wanted Mazzulla to walk barefoot on mountains amid dangerous wildlife. He wanted Mazzulla to be tossed around by the Pacific Ocean.

We lose Game 7 and Im sitting there, and I just said, [Expletive] it. Weve got to do this,  Mazzulla said. Its a breaking point where if Im going to be a head coach, if were going to really go after something, I have to go there. 

Two days later Mazzulla, his wife Camai, and their two sons flew to Costa Rica, where Mazzulla would spend eight agonizing, rewarding, and beautiful days navigating Waitzkins cave process. He said it was everything he needed.

Today, Waitzkin is Mazzullas mentor, ally, and jiu-jitsu sparring partner. His hiring as a Celtics consultant this season was never made public, and few outside the organization are even aware he is here. But he has become one of Mazzullas most trusted confidants as the coach tries to guide the Celtics to their second consecutive NBA championship.

I need Josh to make me better so I can help the team be better, Mazzulla said. Thats how its always been.

"2025-05-05",1746434124,"Does defense win championships? A statistical analysis revealing a shift In playoff defense's impact this year.","I did a quick dive into some NBA stats to put 'Defense wins championships' statement to the test and see whether defense truly becomes more important in the playoffs and if a trend exists.

I pulled Defensive Rating (DRtg) and Winning Percentage (WP) data for teams across the Regular Season and Playoffs for the last seven seasons (2018/19-2024/25). All data used for this analysis was sourced from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/). The Regular Season data for 2024/25 is complete, while the Playoffs 2025 data included here is based only on games played up to the end of the first round.

# Key Metrics

Before diving into the correlations, here's a quick rundown of the main statistics used:

* Defensive Rating (DRtg): An estimate of points allowed per 100 possessions by a team. Lower is better defensively.
* Winning Percentage (WP): The standard measure of a team's success based on their win-loss record (Wins divided by Total Games). Higher is better.
* Net Rating (NRtg): The difference between a team's Offensive Rating (points scored per 100 possessions) and their Defensive Rating. It's a measure of a team's overall efficiency. Higher is better.

# Analysis Methodology

To examine the relationship between defense and winning, I calculated the correlation between a team's DRtg and their WP for both the Regular Season and Playoffs each year. I also calculated the correlation between DRtg and NRtg to see how defense impacts overall team efficiency.

A Quick Note on Interpretation: since DRtg is a lower is better stat, for simplicity in showing the strength of this desired relationship, the values in the tables below represent the correlation multiplied by -1. **So, a higher number in the table indicates a stronger link between good defense and winning.** The 'Difference' column shows the change from Regular Season to Playoffs (Playoffs value - Regular Season value). A negative difference means the correlation dropped in the playoffs, while a positive difference means it increased.

# Correlation between Defensive Rating (DRtg) and Winning Percentage (WP)

Here's the results by year and phase:

|Year|Regular Season|Playoffs|Difference|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2024/25|0.795|0.835|0.040|
|2023/24|0.751|0.460|\-0.291|
|2022/23|0.786|0.447|\-0.339|
|2021/22|0.770|0.657|\-0.113|
|2020/21|0.565|0.533|\-0.032|
|2019/20|0.839|0.644|\-0.195|
|2018/19|0.760|0.429|\-0.331|

Looking at the Playoffs column, the correlation between DRtg and WP in the 2024/25 season is 0.835, a remarkably high absolute value compared to the Playoff correlations in the previous years.

Looking at the Difference column from the 2018/19 through the 2023/24 seasons, there's a pretty clear and consistent pattern: the correlation between DRtg and WP dropped when moving from the Regular Season to the Playoffs for six straight seasons. This suggested that while defense is important in the RS, its relative correlation strength with winning percentage seemed to decrease come playoff time in those years.

But looking at the 2024/25 season, **the difference is positive**. Based on this first-round data, for the first time in the last seven years, the correlation between DRtg and WP didn't drop in the playoffs compared to the regular season but it actually went up.

# Correlation between Defensive Rating (DRtg) and Net Rating (NRtg)

Looking at the correlation between Defensive Rating and Net Rating:

|Year|Regular Season|Playoffs|Difference|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2024/25|0.823|0.900|0.077|
|2023/24|0.768|0.578|\-0.190|
|2022/23|0.825|0.468|\-0.357|
|2021/22|0.801|0.488|\-0.313|
|2020/21|0.604|0.553|\-0.051|
|2019/20|0.848|0.679|\-0.169|
|2018/19|0.813|0.626|\-0.187|

Looking at the Playoffs column, the correlation between DRtg and NRtg in the 2024/25 season is 0.9, an extremely high absolute value, even higher than the WP correlation, and stands out significantly compared to the Playoff correlations in other years shown.

Looking at the Difference column for NRtg across the 2018/19-2023/24 seasons reveals an even more drastic drop in correlation from Regular Season to Playoffs compared to the DRtg vs. WP table. This large negative difference year after year strongly suggests that in previous playoffs, Offensive Rating played a significantly more dominant role in determining a team's overall performance, effectively reducing the statistical impact of defense on Net Rating in the postseason. However, in the 2024/25 season, the NRtg Difference is also positive, marking a dramatic reversal.

# Playoff Teams Only Subset

To further isolate the effect of the playoff environment itself, I also calculated the Regular Season WP correlations only for the subset of teams that actually made the playoffs each year.

|Year|Regular Season|Playoffs|Difference|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2024/25|0.572|0.835|0.263|
|2023/24|0.456|0.460|0.004|
|2022/23|0.420|0.447|0.027|
|2021/22|0.766|0.657|\-0.109|
|2020/21|0.286|0.533|0.247|
|2019/20|0.792|0.644|\-0.148|
|2018/19|0.242|0.429|0.187|

Here the numbers are still very relevant, especially if you look at the difference between the 2023/24 and 2024/25 seasons, but the results are more fluctuating.

# Conclusions and Possible Explanations

Based on the data presented in the previous sections, 'defense wins championships' appears to have been statistically less supported in recent past seasons, where the correlation between defense and winning decreased in the playoffs. However, the data from the current 2024/25 season suggests a potential shift in this trend.

One factor that many of us have noticed this postseason is the reduced **foul calling by refs**. If defenders are being allowed to play more physically without the whistle, defense becomes more effective and thus more correlated with preventing points and ultimately, winning.

This interpretation is also potentially supported by the fact that the playoff field itself hasn't drastically changed from last year; looking at the second round teams, 7 out of the 8 teams are the same as in the 2024 playoffs, with only minor roster changes for most. It would be great if someone could do an analysis on foul rates per possession or defensive play type across recent playoff seasons to see if the numbers support this.

While officiating seems a plausible explanation, are there other factors at play? Given that the playoff field is largely unchanged, could the specific matchups within this group be favoring defensive teams this year? Is there a league-wide shift towards more physical and defensive play?

# Limitations

As mentioned earlier, the analysis for the 2024/25 season is currently based only on data from the first round, which represents approximately half of the total possible playoff games. The correlation could certainly change as the sample size grows and we get deeper into later rounds. I plan to re-run this analysis once the playoffs are complete to see if this trend holds throughout.

Still, it's a statistically interesting start that suggests defense might be playing a relatively larger role in determining playoff wins this season compared to the immediate past.","nba",29,"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1kf6mu9/does_defense_win_championships_a_statistical/"

He also set the foundation and helped transform the Kings into a pretty strong team.

As an assistant coach, he laid the groundwork for the Cavs No. 1 seed this year. And then this year helps turn the Pistons into a solid team.

He did a lot of nice adjustments and coaching work, turned bad teams to great teams, but somehow doesnt quite reap the reward.

[Paywalled article](https://open.substack.com/pub/marcstein/p/the-season-is-suddenly-over-for-the?r=24a6et&amp;utm_medium=ios)

&gt; The Rockets, league sources say, did not see themselves as a championship threat & not even after snagging the West's No. 2 seed. They understand that the Thunder, while even younger, are farther along in the chase for true contention.

&gt; Yet much like Oklahoma City last season, Houston had been planning to use this entire season  especially the playoffs  to evaluate a roster filled with recent lottery picks. 

&gt; The plan was always to capitalize on the crucible of the postseason for crucial data collection before deciding what major swings, if any, to take this offseason.

&gt; It was strongly conveyed to The Stein Line going into the playoffs that a Houston trade pursuit of Durant had become even ""less likely"" than previously thought. 

&gt;**The Suns naturally want the Rockets to want to Durant and, according to league sources, did try to engage them in Durant dialogue before the Feb. 6 trade deadline.** 

&gt;It makes total sense for Phoenix, given that Houston has swap-rights control of the Suns' first-round pick this June and again in 2027 and 2029, but the Rockets passed on the concept then and remain resistant to entertaining the idea of surrendering premium assets in a trade for a 36-year-old with one season left on his current contract.","nba",267,"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1kfmrb5/fischer_the_suns_naturally_want_the_rockets_to/"

"2025-05-05",1746477028,"Would Pippen Start on Any Post 2013 LeBron Team","Ok hear me out. Ive been arguing this topic with a couple people recently and I need to know what you guys think. 

My logic is as follows

LeBrons 2nd stint with the Cavs had the following lineup

"" PG: Kyrie Irving
"" SG: Dion Waiters (eventually JR Smith)
"" SF: LeBron James
"" PF: Kevin Love
"" C: Anderson Varejao (eventually Mozgov)

Who goes in this lineup? 

My friend says obviously Waiters because Pippen &gt; Waiters, which is clearly true. No one would argue Pippen isnt a better player than Dion Waiters. But that gives you the following


Irving: 62
Pippen: 68
James: 69
Love: 68
Varejao/Mozgov: 611/71

How does this team guard the small ball lineups everyone was running, like the Warriors or Rockets? This lineup is a defensive liability especially on the perimeter 

The Lakers are a similar situation

Pippen isnt playing Center because then the Lakers would be way undersized, hes not replacing Bron or AD, so whos left? Danny Green? Obviously Pippen &gt; Green but does it fit the scheme?

Im admittedly dumb as a box of rocks sometime so maybe im way off base. But I dont think a giant lineup like that is the best matchup in todays NBA


Edit: to be clear this is not a Scottie Pippen hate post nor is it questioning whether hes more talented than the guys were discussing. I just love hypothetical scenarios and my question is how these rosters match up against teams like the Warriors or Rockets ","nba",136,"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1kfm2wv/would_pippen_start_on_any_post_2013_lebron_team/"

Kenny had some interesting quotes in the article about the plays that led to the injuries:

So No. 1 was the non-call on DeAndre's layup, which I don't know. Everyone in the world just look at that play, and they reviewed it, and I'm just in shock. I dunno.

""And then Evan, around the same time, I can't remember if it was before or after, (Myles) Turner contests his 2-point shot, comes under, clearly under him.

At this point if he can be on a Jordan clarkson jazz lvl scorer when the jazz were good hell be good. But as a starter ; he doesnt do well that warrants giving him this much of a leash of excuses. I just cant believe hes gonna be a starting caliber  guard. And honestly Ill rather see Sheppard play more often rn than green. Green hasnt jumped over that offensive chucker wall.

Living in San Antonio for decades, Ive crossed paths with Pop a few times through some mutual connections and/or events.  Theres no personal relationship and he wouldnt know me from Adam, but weve crossed and had a couple short conversations.  

A couple years ago, the Spurs played the Warriors in the Alamodome.  It was the game to set the attendance record and I was able to get court-side seats.  I took my boys, 10 and 12 at the time.  

Following a normal shellacking, my son (10) was standing by the ropes/tunnel high-fiving players as they went to the locker room as I stood behind him.  There were a ton of people around trying to get autographs or pictures.  

Pop walked straight up to my son and put his arm around him and asked him his name. Then he asked him how he was doing in school, what his favorite subject is, and what he wanted to be.  He said he was proud of him and made him promise to work hard every single day in school and hugged him and disappeared to the locker room.  

Didnt acknowledge me, or any other adult or autograph seeker out there.  Not a single mention of basketball.  Didnt care about having lost.  Just stopped to make a genuine connection with my son and encourage him.  

I get choked up thinking about it and especially after watching his PC today.  There are plenty of player stories about him, but the man genuinely cares about other people, and seeing it first hand is a core memory for both my boy and I.

Jalen Green is only 23 years old.  But he has demonstrated no improvement whatsoever over the past 3 years.  That's very disturbing for a young player with no injury issues and plenty of playing time.  

His contract guarantees him $105M over the next 3 years.  In my opinion, he has a negative trade value.  The Rockets will have to package with him multiple picks just to unload his contract.  I just don't see any team allocating 20% of their salary cap to Jalen Green over the next 3 years.

Jordan was pre-social media so he was able to get away with a ton of things, then as soon as he's gone we get LeBron who has been scandal free which is amazing given that he's been in the spotlight since he's been a zygote.

You then have the babyface assassin come in who no dad would have issue with coming over for Thanksgiving dinner..and within that time you had some combination of Shaq/Duncan/KD/Giannis/Doncic/Jokic/others being the stars who are either extremely charismatic or keep to themselves.

Iverson for a shortwhile seemed to be David Stern's worst nightmare as far as image goes but he implements a dress code and all is solved.

And finally we can't ignore what happened with Kobe, but miraculously they cloned him, changed his jersey number, and he becomes one of the most beloved guys in NBA history.

Now with Anthony Edwards potentially taking the torch at becoming one of the most marketable guys in the league given that he's explosive, brash, and perhaps most importantly, American.

"2025-05-06",1746557887,"OKC Thunder after game 1 loss comes down to 3 main points","#1 Bad coaching and clock management 

I think most of the this sub realized OKC was fouling too early and most importantly, the foul they committed with 11 seconds should not have happened. After the score, Thunder were up by 3 and Jokic was on the bench + Denver had no timeouts left. You take your chances without Jokic (Worst case, it goes to OT assuming OKC dont foul on a made 3 PT shot).

On another note, coaching staff also need to keep their rotations tight to 8-man at this stage (maybe 9 if situation warrants). They went with a 10 man rotation and nobody got in rhythm except for Caruso. To be fair, Jaylin Williams only played like 3 mins but he was involved in critical play(s).


#2 OKC just does not have a second player that is consistent (other than SGA). Frankly, this is more concerning looking ahead

Denver is the first legitimate contender they faced in the playoffs this year (and DAL last year). Jalen Williams struggled mightily in game 1 vs DEN and was mediocre last year vs DAL. He tends to play well against bad/good teams but the drop-off is apparent against elite teams (especially in the playoffs). If OKC are to reach their title aspirations, he has to be elite and do it consistently.

#3 Rebounding


Obviously, Jokic was a monster on the glass but Aaron Gordon also had 14 rebounds and 7 of them were offensive rebounds. Overall, Thunder got out rebounded DEN:63-OKC:43 and gave up 21 offensive rebounds (including at critical moments in the game). 

Thunder has size with iHart and Chet but the guards really need to help way more here as Chet/iHart will be primarily focused on battling with Jokic and keeping him off the glass. 


Other observations:

Alex Caruso is a demon. This dude was so impressive on both ends. He ended up with 5 STL and 2 BLK but could have easily gotten more if some of the deflections bounced the right way. I dont expect him to score 20 every game but his defense is going to be a problem for DEN. 

Has anyone seen MPJ?

&gt;Heading into the offseason, the Pistons and Beasley have mutual interest in agreeing to a new contract, league sources told HoopsHype.

&gt; Heading into free agency, Detroit has non-Bird rights on Beasley. This means the Pistons can only offer him a maximum starting salary of $7.2 million without using cap space or the non-taxpayer mid-level exception worth $14.1 million. Thus, the more likely path for Detroit to retain Beasley, given his expected market, is for the Pistons to use cap space or the non-tax mid-level exception to sign him for more money.

&gt; **Dennis Schroeder**

&gt;Heading into the offseason, Detroit is interested in re-signing Schroeder, league sources told HoopsHype.

&gt;The Pistons have early Bird rights on him and his style of play fits Detroit well.

&gt;With Cade Cunningham a strong candidate to earn an All-NBA selection and increase his salary for next season, Detroits potential cap space would shrink and could likely lead them to operate as a team over the cap.

There have been previous guys like Jeff Green that have had some crucial games for their teams in the post-season, but not as often as Westbrook has done.

Westbrook has been a big part of 4 of the Nuggets wins.

In the 4 wins Westbrook is averaging: 

17.5/4/2.8/1.8 on 46.3/38.1/70.6 shooting splits(56.9 true shooting percentage). He is +13 in his minutes.

https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/russell-westbrook-stats-in-playoffs-wins-this-season

Here are his stats overall in all 7 games: 
https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/russell-westbrook-stats-in-nuggets-playoffs-wins


In his worst game and the one he played the fewest minutes, game 3 against the Clippers where he was 1-5 in 9 minutes, they lost by 34. In the following game where he didn't play they won by 2 with MPJ stepping up big time.
 

While having watched the games he's made big baskets in clutch situations as well as big defensive plays in similar moments as well. In game 7 at the start of the 2nd he helped ignite the Nuggets to go on a run and was +16 in the quarter after playing the entire quarter having a 10/2/3/2 stataline on 3/4 shooting, 2/3 from 3, and 2-4 from the line.

Even in game 1 of the Clippers series, which is the single game bringing down his shooting stats in the wins, he was crucial in the clutch hitting 3 shots in the 4th when the game was within 1 including the eventual 3 that allowed them to go into OT.

In the regular season Westbrook was huge in helping keep the Nuggets afloat early in the season when Murray was struggling to find his form and the Nuggets overall were struggling. 

This isn't to say Westbrook isn't still heavily flawed, rather it's acknowledging he's a heavily flawed player that is only being paid 3 million this year and thus comparing him to other players that have historically been in his position.

I am not including players that were bought out then signed by teams as minimum players. I don't think Jordan should count either as he was owner of the Wizards so took minimum salary. Even if you include players that were bought out and then played with other teams I believe Westbrook would still have a solid argument.","nba",82,"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1kgaayg/is_westbrook_the_best_minimum_paid_player_ever/"

&gt;The home of the 76ers and Flyers will have a new name on Sept. 1, when the building becomes Xfinity Mobile Arena following the expiration of Wells Fargos naming rights deal.

&gt;The agreement runs through the 2030-31 season, when both teams are scheduled to move into a new arena that will be built at the South Philly sports complex. Comcast Spectacor, which owns the current building and the Flyers, and Harris Blitzer Sports &amp; Entertainment, which owns the Sixers, announced in January that they had entered a binding 50-50 agreement to construct the new venue. That followed the Sixers controversial multi-year pursuit to build their own arena on East Market Street in Center City.

...

&gt;Lederer also described Xfinity Mobile as a young wireless brand compared to more established providers, and hopes having the name on the arena can build recognition in the Philly area and nationally. He is also looking forward to a more active partnership with the Sixers. 

&gt;That should solve the awkwardness that, for the better part of a decade, the Sixers refused to publicly use the full name of the Wells Fargo Center. Officials referred to it as simply The Center, because that bank was not an official sponsor of the organization. 

&gt;The new name will also come with cutting-edge WiFi capabilities for Xfinity customers inside the building, per a news release. Lederer added the company is also exploring ways to expand those signal capabilities out to the sports complexs vast parking lots, where fans tailgate before events year-round.","nba",34,"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1kg8q2c/philadelphia_inquirer_wells_fargo_center_will/"

"2025-05-06",1746540991,"Tom Haberstroh on why Harden disappears in high leverage games: ""I can understand why officials would be reluctant to bail him out on that play and give him an almost automatic three points. Historically, Hardens other-worldly ability to draw the three-shot foul tends to abandon him in Game 7s.""","&gt;Harden often seems more interested in trying to get the 3-point foul call than actually making the shot. I can understand why: its the most profitable play in the game! Three free throws for a career 86 percent free-throw shooter? Dunks arent even worth that much. The league changed the three-shot foul rules because of that guy.

&gt;But Harden still gets a ton of them  at least before the postseason started. In this regular season, referees gave him that call quite a bit. After the All-Star break, Harden tallied a whopping 26 fouled 3s while no other player registered more than 11. The Clipper vet generated more three-shot fouls after the break than 28 entire ROSTERS.

&gt;In a postseason setting, its a different ballgame. He rarely gets that call. Especially in a slow-paced Game 7 when referees tend to let the players decide the game. He certainly didnt get one on Saturday. And it seemed to completely throw him off his game.

&gt;Taking away Hardens three-shot foul weapon is like taking away Anthony Edwards hops. Theyre still really good, if weakened, players, but they have to adapt and impact the game elsewhere. And you know what? Harden has done that to a remarkable extent, averaging 2.6 steals, 1.3 blocks and 7.9 assists in Game 7s  something no other player has done in those spots.

&gt;Harden is a brilliant basketball player, but its entirely possible that, without a generous whistle, he gets in his own head on the perimeter. The stepbacks and flails dont work. He becomes more of a playmaking role player, which simply isnt good enough for your superstar.

"2025-05-06",1746537059,"[Original Content] Some Game Theory Why You Should Foul Up By 3","Alright guys I know that obviously right now it is the popular opinion that fouling up by 3 angers the basketball Gods and the Thunder deserved to lose and fouling up by 3 is bad obviously the Thunder lost so it is bad duuhhhhhh - but I wanted to do some calcs on a few scenarios to give you all a better idea why statistically fouling up by 3 makes sense. Yes. I know basketball isn't played on a spreadsheet. Yes, I know there is variance. Yes, I know that my assumptions are vague and aren't perfect. Yes, I know that Chet missed 2 free throws and the lights were too bright. Yes, I AGREE THAT THE EXECUTION WAS BAD AND YOU SHOULDN'T FOUL GORDON IN THE BACK COURT WITH JOKIC ON THE BENCH. All I am doing here is trying to explain just a little bit why, GENERALLY, fouling up by 3 makes sense.

Situation: Team 1 is up by 3 with 12 seconds left over the with losing team (Team 2) in bounding the ball.

First Assumption: Let's say that in bounding the ball and fouling for either team takes 3 seconds each.

Second Assumption: Three point shots when down by 3 have a 30% chance to make the shot. I understand that league avg is around 36% but when the defense knows you're shooting a 3 the odds go down significantly.

Third Assumption: Two point shots are 50%. Too many factors can affect this number but let's just say clutch time lowers the 54-55% league average by a bit.

Fourth assumption: Let's say everyone is an 80% FT shooter

    therefore 	0/2 odds: 4%
    		1/2 odds: 32%
    		2/2 odds: 64%

Fifth Assumption: Let's say the defensive team gets the rebound 75% of the time on shots from the field, and 100% on free throws (I know that it's more like 95% but there would be a rabbit hole of calcs if I give FT OREBs &lt;100% chance so please just assume Russ isn't a superhuman every FT)

Scenario 1: Winning team doesn't foul, losing team goes for game tying 3 with not enough time for other stuff to happen.

Let's ignore the flukey stuff that can happen, like a 4 point play from Ivey to fire the King's coach, or stealing the in bounds after a made 3, etc... This one is simple: **Team 1 wins 70% of the time, and we go to OT 30% of the time.**

Scenario 2: Shooting with 7+ seconds left, more outcomes could happen, obviously.

We can dispute the following percentages, but hopefully we can follow the logic.

Missed shot (70%) -&gt; defensive rebound (75%) = 52.5% of outcomes

Missed shot (70%) -&gt; offensive rebound (25%) = 17.5%

	(after offensive rebound) -&gt; made shot = 5.25%

\-&gt; missed shot = 12.25%

Made shot (30%) -&gt; the leading team gets a chance to win. Let's say with the game tied and 4? seconds to go, there is a 30% for the winning team to win in regulation

		\\-&gt; Team 1 basket is good = 30% \\\\\\\* 30% = 9%    
  
		\\-&gt; Team 1 basket is no good = 21%

Summing up these outcomes: **Team 1 wins 73.75% of the time, while we go OT 26.25% of these instances.**

Scenario 3: we play the foul game. I don't expect you to go through every calc but they are here in case you want to follow along or check my work. NOTE: I ROUND A LITTLE BIT. IT IS 11:00 PM. SUE ME.

12 seconds: Team 1 fouls team 2 with 9 seconds to go

    4% to still be up by 3
    
    32% to be up by 2
    
    64% to be up by 1

9 seconds: Team 2 fouls team 1 with 6 seconds to go

    In the 4% of scenarios where Team 1 is up by 3:
    
    	T1 misses both - 4% \* 4% = .16% to still be up by 3
    
    	T1 goes 1/2 - 4% \* 32% = 1.28% to be up by 4 now
    
    	T1 goes 2/2 = 2.56% to be up by 5
    
    32% to be up by 2:
    
    	T1 misses both - 32% \* 4\* = 1.28% to be up by 2
    
    	T1 goes 1/2 - 32% \* 32% = 10.24% to be up by 3
    
    	T1 goes 2/2 = 20.48% to be up by 4
    
    64% to be up 1:
    
    	T1 misses both - 64% \* 4% = 2.56% to be up by 1
    
    	T1 goes 1/2 - 64% \* 32% = 20.48% to be up by 2
    
    	T1 goes 2/2 = 40.96% to be up by 3

Summing it up, with 6 seconds to go if both teams foul:

    2.56% to be up by 5
    
    21.76% to be up by 4
    
    51.36% to be up by 3
    
    21.76% to be up by 2
    
    2.56% to be up by 1

Let's just say that if they are up by 4 or 5, the game is cooked = **24.32% win outright after 2 iterations of foul game.**

If they are up by less than 3, Team 1 does not want to foul.

    When down by 1, Team 2 can shoot a 2 or 3 for the win, but let's just say they'll shoot a 2 for the win
    
    2.56% \* 0.5 = 	1.28% team 1 wins
    1.28% team 2 wins



    When down by 2, I'll say there's a 50% Team 2 goes for the win and 50% Team 2 goes for the tie
    
    (1/2) 21.76 \* 0.3 = 3.204% loss
    
    (1/2) 21.76 \* 0.7 = 7.616% win
    
    (1/2) 21.76 \* 0.5 = 5.44% tie
    
    (1/2) 21.76 \* 0.5 = 5.44% win

summing it up, out of the 21.76% chance that it is a 2 point game:

    		3.204% loss
    
    		13.056% win
    
    		5.44% tie

So far excluding the 51.36% of 3 point games, our results:

    24.32% Team 1 
    
    1.28% Team 1 
    
    1.28% Team 2
    
    13.056 Team 1
    
    3.204% Team 2
    
    5.44% TIE
    
    	== 	**38.656% Team 1 wins**
    
    		**5.44% TIE**
    
    		**4.484% Team 2 wins**

God, now we dive back in to the up by 3 scenario, but fouling with 3 seconds left

    51.36% \* 0.04 = 2.0544% chance still up by 3
    
    		16.4352% up by 2
    
    		32.8704 up by 1

Even though in this scenario, given my original assumptions, Team 1 would not go to the line again because it'd take 3 seconds to foul again, but let's pretend Team 1 lost their mind and didn't take up the 3 seconds to foul Team 2 a few times and there is a little time left... I know, how ridiculous would it be to foul immediately instead of after waiting a few seconds. These are NBA coaches... there's absolutely no way they would foul immediately instead of telling their team to waste a few seconds hahaha no way this ever happens hahahahaha especially when Team 2's forward is 75 away from the basket hahahahahahhaaha

    Up 3 -&gt;  4 or more points = 1.97%
    
    Up 3 -&gt; 3 points = 0.08%
    
    Up 2 -&gt; 2 points = 0.66%
    
    Up 2 -&gt; 3 points = 5.26%
    
    Up 2 -&gt; 4 points = 10.5184%
    
    Up 1 -&gt; 1 point = 1.315%
    
    Up 1 -&gt; 2 point = 10.518%
    
    Up 1 -&gt; 3 point = 21%

Summing it up, after Team 1 goes to the line a second time:

    Up 1 point: 1.315%
    
    Up 2 points: 11.18%
    
    Up 3 points: 26.34%
    
    Up 4 or more: 12.49%

Up 4 = cooked.

There's only a few seconds left so final half court heave... let's say 20% to be super generous

    Up 1 or 2 = 12.495 \* 0.2 = 2.5% team 2 wins
    
    	12.495 \* 0.8 = 10% team 1 wins
    
    	Up 3 = 26.34% \* 0.2 = 5.27% tie
    
    	21.07% team 1 wins

TO SUM IT UP: PLAYING THE FOUL GAME IF WE GO ALONG WITH MY ASSUMPTIONS,

    TEAM 1 WIN: 24.32 + 1.28 + 13.056 + 12.49 + 10 + 21.07 = 82.216%
    
    TIE: 5.44%
    
    TEAM 2 WIN: 1.28 + 3.204% + 2.5% = 6.984%

GOD I KNOW THESE EQUAL 94.64% BUT I HAVE WORK IN THE MORNING AND TOOK STATS 8 YEARS AGO AND YEAH THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A BIT OF ROUNDING THE 1000TH DECIMAL FUUUUUCK

Keeping the proportion (multiplying the above numbers by 1.05663567..)

**TEAM 1 WIN: 86.85%**

**TIE: 5.75%**

**TEAM 2 WIN: 7.4%**

TL;DR

Given the assumptions:

&gt;Now, he will do so again when NBC promotes its NBA coverage that begins again next season. However, the setup is rather unique because Fagan died in 2017.

&gt;In an agreement between the network and Fagans family, NBC will use Fagans AI-generated voice to create modern promos with an old-time feel. NBC said it will also hire current vocal artists to complement their presentations.

And you know what? They have in common in terms of dominating the MVP races.

**1980s BIRD**

1981 - 2nd in MVP Race

1982 - 2nd in MVP Race

1983 - 2nd in MVP Race

1984 - MVP

1985 - MVP

1986 - MVP

1987 - 3rd in MVP Race

1988 - 2nd in MVP Race

**2020s JOKIC**

2021 - MVP

2022 - MVP

2023 - 2nd in MVP Race

2024 - MVP

2025 - (most likely 2nd in MVP Race)

**---**

Both of them dominated their decade in terms of MVP And MVP Runner Up Finishes.

And Jokic has 4 more years to add into his resume in 2020s.

Do you think Jokic will be able to surpass Bird in terms of MVP and MVP Runner up Finishes?

"2025-05-06",1746511211,"[EFFORT] SGA didn't have a bad game, he just didn't outplay Jokic","***NOTE:*** *This has nothing to do with putting down Jokic, who played a great game. I think Jokic is the best player in the world, and has been for quite some time. He will be compared to once simply to show a difference in what it means to be efficient. Outside of that, it will be references to how well he played, and how certain stats don't show his, or SGA's impact properly.*

This is primarily in response to the posts hating on SGA and calling him a ""fraud"" (including one which seems to be retconning last years playoff run where he played very well--trust me, I was rooting for Luka.)

***1. SGA played a very good game, and was more efficient than just TS% measures.***

***His TS% was 53%,*** which is not great. However, ***his AST:TO was 8:1. Jokic had a 6:7***, and he obviously had a great game overall. There are only two ways a possession can end unsuccessfully for a team: through a missed shot, or by a turnover. Turnovers are obviously worse, but for the sake of argument, let's equate the two.

SGA shot 12-26, and had 8:1. Meaning the intended outcome was achieved 20 times, and the unintended outcome was achieved 15 times. Overall, this is a positive and efficient impact. Along with 7-9 from the free throw line, giving 0.5 positive outcomes per make, and 0.5 negative per miss. this becomes \~a ***23.5:16 ratio*** of positive to negative outcomes (this is napkin math, but the point remains)

Jokic for comparison shot 15-29, had a 6:7 ratio, and went 10-13 from the line ***This gives us a positive outcome 26 times, and a negative outcome 21 times.***

(Both went 2-6 from three so there was no need to add any additional 1.5x multipliers to their shot diet.)

This is not to disparage Jokic, who still had a more efficient shooting night overall, this is just to show that simply focusing on a one-game sample size of TS% when ignoring AST:TO as another form of efficiency is removing playmaking from the equation.

***2. One Game Plus-Minus is a horrible statistic when measuring overall quality and impact of a player's performance.***

*SGA was -16 in this game.* ***This does not mean he had an overall negative impact on winning.***

Most posts are contrasting this to Jokic, but this point is about how meaningless this stat is with regards to the team itself.

JDub shot 5-20, 2-9 from 3, and 4-6 from the line, with a 4:1 AST:TO ratio. Using the previous formula, he had 11 positive outcomes, and 17 negative. He did not have a good game. ***His +/- was -6.***

Aaron Wiggins played 14 minutes and took a single shot, making it. He shot 2-2 from the line and had 4 rebounds, one of them offensive. This is solid role-player minutes. ***He finished +16.***

On the Nuggets side, Jokic had the third-highest plus-minus on the team. If there's anyone out there who believes Jokic was only the third-most important player to the Nuggets win tonight, I'd like to offer them a trade of Paul George for their First-Round Pick.

**To sum this up**, this does not mean SGA had a better game than Jokic, or that he's the best player in the world. But it does mean that posts decrying him for arbitrary statistical measures are simply agenda-driven, and posted by people who would rather tear great players down than build them up.

This is the SGA equivalent of people who used to say **""Jokic hasn't beaten a 50-win team!!!""**

Nuggets fans should know first-hand how stupid that narrative was.

.It's ultimately just abusing statistics without context to put others down, which is pathetic. Jokic is the best player in the world, but SGA is top 3 *(there's just a bit of a gap between 3 and 1)*

"2025-05-06",1746506545,"With the Nuggets buzzer beater win against the Thunder, all 3 second round series have seen the 60-win home team lose Game 1.","Sunday:  Pacers beat an injured Cavaliers team (121-112) in regulation.  The latter won 64 games for the 1 seed in the East.

Monday:  Celtics blow a 20-point lead in overtime (108-105).  45 missed 3s are to blame.  Boston won 61 games to lock up the 2 seed in the East.

Monday/early Tuesday when the game officially ended:  Thunder lose to the second Aaron Gordon buzzer beater of this postseason (121-119).  Also Jokic had a ludicrous 40+/20+/5+ game but the real story is yet another Gordon buzzer beater.  68 wins in the regular season with historic advanced stats to boot for the best team in the NBA.

Call the Nuggets, Pacers and Knicks the Phantom Thieves because they stole home court advantage from the get-go.

"2025-05-06",1746569113,"[Thompson] Lakers legend Byron Scott has been accused of sexually assaulting a schoolgirl in a janitor's closet..The incident happened 38 years ago in a locked janitors closet at an exclusive private school in LA. It was the summer of 1987, and Scott was at the school for an event with the Lakers","LA Lakers legend Byron Scott has been accused of sexually assaulting a schoolgirl in a janitor's closet when he was a young, married sporting star. 

Details of the case are included in explosive documents obtained by Daily Mail this week. 

The incident happened 38 years ago in a locked janitors closet at an exclusive private school in LA. It was the summer of 1987, and Scott was at the school for an event with the Lakers team, according to a verified amended complaint. 

The plaintiff, Hayley Dylan, who was 15 at the time, has chosen to reveal her identity rather than remain anonymous. 

**Shockingly, Scott, now 53, admits that he had sexual contact with the girl but says he thought she was 18.** 

Scotts attorney, Linda Bauermeister, told Daily Mail: Our client is devastated by this complaint, a basketball event that took place in 1987.

Our client believed the plaintiff to be over 18 and had no idea she would claim otherwise until 35 years later.

He respects girls and women, and the claims have blindsided him and his family.

Scott was married to first wife Anita Scott, 66, whom he divorced in 2014, at the time.

In the lawsuit, the now 53-year-old accuses the NBA superstar of sexual battery, sexual assault, false imprisonment and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

Dylan also names Campbell Hall School, where she was a student at the time and where the assault allegedly occurred, as a defendant for not protecting her from Scott.

Before the incident, Dylan was a young girl who loved school and had never kissed a boy. 

Afterwards, her innocence was shattered, and her life forever altered,' according to the complaint. 

The 20-page lawsuit details how Scott, who was 26 at the time, allegedly forced himself on the girl after escorting her into an area of the schools gymnasium away from other adults.

Dylan was taking a math summer class at the school during the same time several Lakers players were filming an instructional basketball video in the gym and then also met with students, parents and faculty members.

During a break in filming, staff and parents were with the players until being asked to leave the gym as taping was about to resume.

But then, the complaint claims, Scott pointed to Dylan and told production staff: She can stay.

Despite the teen being left alone with adults, Campbell Hall faculty and staff failed to take any steps or implement any safeguards to supervise or otherwise protect Plaintiff from anything that could, and eventually would, happen to her,' the complaint reads. 

Instead, per the court record, school officials saw it as an opportunity for Hayley to acquire autographs for them from the sports star.

The schools then athletic director took a photograph of Hayley with Scott as they sat together on the bleachers - with the girl positioned between his knees on a lower step. 

The photo was then displayed in the athletic directors office, the complaint says. 

Later, Scott asked Hayley to have lunch with him which, according to the suit, was part of a plan designed to gain Hayleys trust and to further isolate her.

The two picked up food from the craft services and Scott took Hayley into the drama theater located next to the gym where they ate together at a round table. At one point, two of her friends came into the other side of the theater briefly and left.

When filming finished for the day, Scott asked Haley to give him a tour of the schools weight room and other gym facilities which were located underneath the schools basketball court.

Hayley, proud and excited to be able to show off her school to someone she admired, agreed.

Things quickly took a turn for the worse when they were downstairs alone, according to the complaint. 

That is when Scott found an unmarked door at the end of a hallway which he opened, went inside, flicked the light off and on and tested the lock. The room was a janitors closet.

He then forcefully grabbed Hayley by the arm and pulled her inside the room leaving her frightened and confused.

Scott then began kissing her on the mouth as she repeatedly asked what are you doing?

Then, despite her clear protests, Scott pushed Hayley to her knees, and, against her will, pulled off her top. Scott the pulled down his shorts, exposed his erect penis, and tried to force Hayley to perform oral sex on him.'

Hayley was terrified and pleaded for Scott to stop and tried to turn her head away from his erect penis,' the complaint claims. 

Eventually, the complaint says, Scott relented and told his victim to get up off the floor and get dressed then he unlocked the door so she could leave.

Scotts teammates, the Lakers assistant coach, trainer and film production staff had seen him lead Hayley away and then return roughly 20 minutes later, according to the complaint. 

By then, Campbell Hall staff, students and parents had departed for the day.

The players and production crew were having a wrap party outside the gym where alcohol was being served, the suit says. It continues that Scott gave Hayley a beverage - apparently alcohol - which she threw away after one sip. She had never tasted alcohol previously.

By now, Hayley's mind was reeling and she was scared and disoriented.

With no school staff or parents on hand, she had no way to get to her home in Encino a few miles west.

According to Hayley's lawsuit, Scott took her to his car - a red, two-door Mercedes - where they sat and talked for five minutes, with the player focused on discouraging her from telling anyone about the assault.

He suggested the two could hang out and gave her some Lakers merchandise from the trunk of the car, including a satin gym bag with his jersey number on it. Scott wore the number four for the Lakers.

He eventually asked a teammate, who also lived in Encino, if he could take Hayley home but the player - apparently recognizing the inappropriate nature of driving alone with a strange teen, responded: F\*\*k, no. Im not putting that girl in my car.

Instead, she used a payphone to call her mother who picked her up.

It was twenty years later when she learned that rumors of the assault had circulated around the school at the time, when one former student asked her: Are you the girl that hooked up with Byron Scott?

In the years that followed Scotts sexual assault and battery, Hayley suffered, and she continues to suffer, severe psychological and emotional distress, as well as feelings of embarrassment, loss of self-esteem, shame, and humiliation,' states the suit.

Those two teams pretty much had a stronghold in the NBA Finals from 2015 to 2018, owning their respective conferences in that 4-year span.

Change would come when LeBron James took his talents to Hollywood. And so the Cavaliers didn't make it to the dance with the Warriors in 2019. The Warriors would still make the Finals that year. Injury bug, however, caught up to them; losing Kevin Durant to an Achilles tendon injury and losing Klay Thompson to an ACL injury. They would lose to the Raptors in 6 games of that year's Finals.

A thing that would make Stephen A. happy. In a discussion, when asked what it would take for the Knicks to beat the Celtics, Stephen A. said, ""Pray"". And those prayers were answered when the Celtics missed 45 three-point field goal attempts, a record-setting misperformance.

I mean, they heaved up a lot of them and they didn't fall, but IMO the main reason they lost to the Warriors last night was a failure to exploit their inside advantage with Gobert.

"2025-05-07",1746635221,"road teams are 5-0 in round two so far -- and that may be part of a larger trend of a decline in homecourt advantage","Teams with home-court advantage tend to win the majority of their playoff series. But we also have to remember that home teams are generally the better of the two (based on regular season record).

So how valuable is the concept of home-court advantage in a vacuum? It's potentially less valuable than it's ever been before.

As fans, we tend to complain that the constant ""flopping"" and free-throw hunting is ruining the product. But by and large, free throws are a lower percentage of points than they used to be back in the [older days](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_stats_per_game.html). The percentage of points that come via the three pointers have dramatically increased in their stead.

Why is this relevant? Because researchers have posited that ""home-court advantage"" in a game is largely reliant on a preference from referees (who may be biased by the fans' pressure). And referees play a larger role in determining free throws than three pointers. The theory goes: if refs can't affect the outcomes of games as much as they did in the past -- then roaring fans can't affect the outcomes of games as much -- and then home-court can't affect the outcomes of games as much.

If this theory is true -- then we'd expect the results of home-court advantage to have lessened over the last few years. Recent studies have appeared to confirm the concept. As cited [here](https://sports.yahoo.com/fact-or-fiction-is-home-court-advantage-in-the-nbas-regular-season-dead-194958543.html#:~:text=Home%2Dcourt%20advantage%20has%20declined,of%20the%20past%20five%20years.), home teams are winning less often than they used to, down from about 60% to 54%.

Moreover, we have to remember that ""home-court advantage"" in the NBA isn't the same as ""home-field advantage"" in a sport like football. If you're in the NFL and you're the top seed, your opponent has to come into your stadium and win on your turf in the big game. Singular. Game. You have home-field advantage for 1 (of 1) matchups. 100% of the time.

In the NBA, as we know, series are played out over the course of a 7-game series. You get 2 games at home, 2 games on the road, back to home, back to the road, and back to home for the ""decisive"" game 7. So you're not getting home-court advantage 100% of the time -- you're getting it 4/7 times -- 57% of the time.

If that. After all, not every series is actually going a full 7 games. In fact, the stats [here](https://www.nbcsportsboston.com/nba/nba-playoffs-game-7-history-statistics/609963/#:~:text=Postseason%20history%20says%20the%20Finals,38%20Game%207s%20(28.8%25) suggest that NBA playoff series only reach Game 7 in about 25% of all pairings.

So to summarize... if you work hard during the regular season... if you fight tooth and nail to secure a higher seed... you're rewarded with home-court advantage in one extra game (which gives you about a 4-5% better chance of winning that game), in a series that has about a 25% chance of reaching that game in the first place.

Should any of this be a concern? Maybe not. The playoffs have been fun and competitive this year. That said, the decline of home-court advantage may be contributing to the regular season malaise. Franchises have been load managing and coasting in the regular season in order to keep their stars fresh -- but also doing it with the underlying knowledge that home-court advantage is not *that* powerful.","nba",75,"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1kh1nsk/road_teams_are_50_in_round_two_so_far_and_that/"

"2025-05-07",1746633210,"Theory on why the NBA has been delaying the annoucement of MVP award","The Coach of the Year and Executive of the Year awards have already been announcedMVP is the only remaining award.

By tradition, the MVP is unveiled either during the first round or within the first three games of the semifinals, and the announcement sometimes takes place before the recipients next home game so that the celebration can include the fans. However, this tradition has been broken in recent years. I think the NBA does not want people to guess easily who the MVP is, so that they don't watch it live. Also, the announcement date has been getting later each year.

In 2024, the award was announced on May 8, which was one day before OKC vs. Mavs semifinals Game 2 at Oklahoma Citys home arena and two days after Game 2 of the Nuggets vs Twolves semifinals at the Nuggets home arena. Some people guessed Shai or Luka would be MVP based on the announcement date, but they were wrong. The celebration took place in Game 5 (May 12) in Denver.

In 2024, the NBA released the award schedule ahead of time on May 6, two days before the announcement date of May 8.

Since the NBA has not yet released the MVP announcement schedule (and they will not suddenly announce it for the sake of TV ratings), the MVP announcement will be made no earlier than May 9. Today is May 7.

It will likely occur around Game 3 or 4 in Denver. That timing will lure people to watch the annoucement live. An announcement before a game in Denver might create the illusion that Joki will be MVPbut the NBA will likely again surprise us, as they did last year.","nba",38,"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1kh0tfz/theory_on_why_the_nba_has_been_delaying_the/"

"2025-05-07",1746631884,"Controversial referee Scott Foster makes his first appearance in the playoffs this season tonight in OKC as the Thunder host the Nuggets in Game 2","Foster was injured in a game in Miami on March 17th, 2025, suffering a calf strain in the Knicks' 116-95 win. Tonight's game marks his return to the court.

He has been a controversial figure throughout his 29-year career in the NBA, for multiple reasons:

1. He had frequent game day interactions by text with disgraced referee Tim Donaghy, who admitted to gambling on NBA games and was sentenced to prison after pleading guilty to federal charges. According to court records, Donaghy made 134 phone calls to Foster between October 2006 and April 2007. The majority of the calls lasted less than two minutes and occurred shortly before and after games that Donaghy officiated and gambled on. The Donaghy investigation resulted in Foster being interviewed by the FBI and the NBA's lawyer Lawrence Pedowitz declaring him innocent.
2. He's been nicknamed  ""**The Extender**,"" because teams trailing in a playoff series have often won games he has officiated, thus lengthening the series,
3. Foster's refereeing has drawn criticism from fans and players. In a  survey of nearly three dozen NBA players by the LA Times in 2016 and a separate anonymized survey of 108 NBA players by The Athletic in 2023, he was voted the worst referee in the NBA.
4. He has had an ongoing feud with point guard Chris Paul, and the W-L statistics in games Foster has officiated with Pail on the court are remarkable (Paul has a 3-17 playoff record when Foster is the referee, including 13 straight losses) !  After Paul went public about the situation, the league held a meeting with them and Commissioner Adam Silver made the following comments:

*""You have there two veterans who are the best at what they do,* *Scott is one of the highest-rated NBA officials, which is why he referees in our Finals games, and of course Chris, the track record speaks for itself. The way you handle that is at least the way we've tried to handle that is to talk to both and say that the expectation is that you are going to be professionals and deal privately with the two of them and just say 'Whatever the bad blood is between you two, you dont have to be friends but you both have to go out and do your jobs.""*

&gt; 
&gt; Since 2020-21, Draymond has been guilty of committing a foul or violation in 31 similarly illegal plays that werent called in the moment but should have been. Thats the 2nd most among all NBA players on a total basis.
&gt; 
&gt; Only Bam Adebayo has been involved in more plays (32) in which he got away with something he shouldnt have during that time period. But a key difference is that Adebayo has played in 143 games that have a L2M report whereas Green has only played in 110 since 2020-21. When you adjust for the number of games a player appeared in that required a L2M report, Draymond looks like an outlier.

&gt; There are 72 players that have been involved in at least 50 combined calls and no calls during the regular season since 2020-21. Among those 72 players, Draymond has the third lowest Recognition Rate. To put it another way, referees have blown their whistle on Draymond when they should have only 67 percent of the time in the last two minutes of close games. Adebayo and Rudy Gobert are the only two players with a lower Recognition Rate during that time period.

&gt; Since 2015, there have been 166 Lane Violations that occurred in the last two minutes of close games. The refs only called 67 of them in the moment, which is to say Lane Violations are only called 40 percent of the time.

&gt; Playing at home just doesnt mean what it used to. This spring, NBA teams are just 26-24 at home in the playoffs. Thats the lowest playoff winning percentage among home teams since 1981 (the 2020 playoffs were in the bubble).
&gt; 


&gt; While home teams were a game under .500 in the 1981 NBA playoffs, it was a blip. The very next year, home teams won about 60 percent of their playoff games and kept climbing back up each year, right around historical precedent. In fact, home teams won at least 60 percent of their games in 56 of the first 78 postseasons.
&gt; 
&gt; But not recently. Home teams havent crossed the 60 percent threshold since the 2018 playoffs  though they were close in 2022.
&gt; 
&gt; Home-court advantage has also eroded this decade in the most critical circumstance: Game 7. Getting to play the do-or-die game at home used to be a ballast for higher seeds. They won 79.1 percent of Game 7s over the leagues first 73 seasons. Home teams are just 5-10 in a Game 7 since 2021. 
&gt; 

_
&gt; As Kerr said, 3-point shooting has invariably had an impact on the changing structure of the league. Home-court advantage started to wane during the 2016-17 season, right as the NBA hit its 3-point revolution and has not recovered since, as 3-point volume has gone up.
&gt; 
&gt; Taking more 3s as a road team has correlated with higher winning percentage in recent years. This postseason, road teams that have taken at least one more 3-pointer than the home team are 12-9, winning at the same rate as they did last spring.","nba",27,"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1khz44r/vorkunovnyt_this_spring_nba_teams_are_just_2624/"

Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost has been elected to head the Catholic Church under the name Leo XIV. He is the first pope to hail from the United States. A once again historic conclave wrapped up just like that. And for 14 NBA teams in the 2026 NBA playoffs, they better begin saying their prayers, for they will be unfortunate to face one team... the Knicks.

You see, the result of the conclave has had this one correlation with the NBA since 2005. An NBA team that has a star player from the same country as the new pope will make the NBA Finals the year after the new pope seats in the Vatican.

Benedict XVI - Germany - elected in 2005 : Dirk Nowitzki - Germany - played in the 2006 NBA Finals

Francis - Argentina - elected in 2013 : Manu Ginobili - Argentina - played in the 2014 NBA Finals

Leo XIV - American - Villanova alumni - elected in 2025 : Jalen Brunson - American - Villanova alumni - ?

Now granted, I had to stretch this conspiracy to the alma mater of the new pope because it would discredit my tinfoil hat mind to include all of the American NBA players, and the Spurs made the NBA Finals the same year Francis came in, but this is my crackhead conspiracy and I can make shit up.

Congrats to the New York Knicks on winning the 2026 Eastern Conference Championship! Unless of course, Leon Rose or Gersson Rosas pulls a Nico. I've also got my eye on you, James.

Hes elite athletically with the first step, acceleration and stopping on a dime at such high rate of speed. Most players are lucky to be able to do even one of those things as well as SGA, let alone combining all of them

[https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/t/tatumja01/gamelog-playoffs/](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/t/tatumja01/gamelog-playoffs/)

Tatum: 37/119 playoff games

Luka: 5/55 playoff games

Giannis: 18/84 playoff games

Jokic: 13/89 playoff games

Steph: 32/155 playoff games

LeBron: 31/292 playoff games

KD: 14/170 playoff games

Harden: 73/173 playoff games

Other than James Harden, who is notoriously known to be an all time playoff dropper and choker, Tatum has the worst percentage of playoff games scoring under 20 points (31% of his total games). 42 of Tatum's 119 playoff games are at 40% from the field or worse.

This may be the worst stat of them all: Tatum has 75 (!!!) games of his 119 in the playoffs where he has shot 33% from 3 or worse. He only has 44 games shooting above 33% from 3. This is a career 37% shooter in the regular season.

We all know Tatum has made strides in his playmaking over the regular season (and usually increases his assists during the playoffs). But his efficiency has been falling off a cliff. Even in the regular season, he shot fucking 34% from 3. We can talk about his defensive versatility as much as we want (he's been awful against the Knicks on that end too), and he is good rebounder, but god damn this is the 3rd playoff run in a row since the 2022 finals where Tatum's offense has fallen off a cliff, and he cannot be depended upon to score consistently.

For comparison to contemporary stars - Jalen Brunson had a bad game 2 (still clinched the game with FTs), but I fully expect him to score 20+ in game 3, similar to how he did in game 1. He had fucking Ausar Thompson breathing down his neck all of the Pistons series and still averaged 31.5 and 8. I respect Brunson so much, dude is 6 feet tall and even in games where his shot isn't falling, I have complete faith he will make the right plays in the 4th quarter. His offensive process is much smarter too, he will attack the paint and get 10-12 foot jumpers and floaters to help even out his scoring.

Haliburton has been clutch, shooting well and winning games against good teams.

Donovan Mitchell almost dropped 50 in game 2 and would've won the game if Hali wasn't so clutch at the end.

Steph is like fucking 35+ and getting hounded by Amen Thompson and an elite Houston defense and found ways to score and play well.

Kawhi damn near lost his knee and was damn good and consistent throughout the Nuggets series.

The only other star who isn't shooting well right now is Ant, and in his defense he is a few years younger than Tatum and also he shot 40% from 3 leading the league in 3's this past season - something Tatum has never done.  And I'd argue Ant is playing much better defense currently than Tatum in the playoffs.

Tatum has zero go-to moves. That side-step 3 is abysmal, and he doesn't have consistent aggression in driving to the basket, and sometimes his finishing is horrible. If he's not having a 4-9 from 3PT game, then he's most likely not going to hit 20 or 25 points. He hasn't been passing at some elite level to compensate either. Yes, he played well against the 7 seed injured Magic, but this Knicks series is what really matters. I just don't know if Tatum has it in him to score efficiently against good defenders. He's good at multiple different things, but he is not great at any individual thing. You can say he has ""no weaknesses,"" but clearly if anyone has watched the last 2 games, his weaknesses jump off the screen.

If Tatum doesn't become a dependable scorer from 2PT range (something that every elite playoff player can do - Jokic, Steph, Kawhi, KD, Bron, even Giannis), he will always be a low-floor high-ceiling player. And he hasn't honestly had any high-ceiling performances in a while. Whoever got into Tatum's head the last few years and told him that the only way to play basketball is from drives/kicks and 3's needs to be under investigation. It has destroyed Tatum's offensive versatility and made his game way too dependent on 3's/layups in a weird analytics way.



Calling him top 5 feels wrong too, considering Jokic/Giannis/SGA/Luka are all guys who don't go full quarters without being able to buy a bucket. And if you look at the second half of the top 10, guys like Brunson, Donovan, Steph, Bron, KD, Ant, etc are all guys who don't have multiple duds in a row either. The consistency is what matters, and Tatum doesn't have that yet.

  
EDIT: Since people wanted more context, here's some updated stats:

  
Tatum since 2020 playoffs (ignoring the first two years when he was more of a role player)

21/87 games under 20 points.

Regular season vs. Playoff True Shooting:

2019-20 RS: 56.7% (23.4PPG)  Playoffs: 56.3%  (25.7PPG)

2020-21 RS: 57.6% (26.4PPG) TS Playoffs: 57.7% (30.6PPG) 

(this is when it started getting worse)

2021-22 RS: 57.8% (26.9PPG) Playoffs: 56.2% (25.6 PPG)

2022-23 RS: 60.7% (30.1 PPG) Playoffs: 58.5%  (27.2  PPG)

2024-25 RS: 58.2% (26.8 PPG) Playoffs: 54% (26.8PPG) 

The drop off in regular season to playoff efficiency keeps getting worse and worse. And post-2021, which is the last season when people truly trusted Tatum's 3PT and midrange scoring consistently, he has been scoring less at worse efficiency.

We've seen that illustrated in the second round -- where road teams have gone 6-1 so far -- but also over a larger sample size over the last decade. These playoffs have been a lot of fun so it's hard to complain about them, but it's fair to wonder if the league should consider strengthening seeding and home-court advantage in some way. After all, the NBA already has a problem with teams coasting through the regular season -- and that could get worse if teams cared about home-court even less than they do now.

There have been a few proposals floated around, but I'll save my favorite for last.

---

**proposal 1: allowing top seeds to pick their opponent**

The idea that the top seed can pick any conference opponent they want has been championed by several pundits including Kevin O'Connor from yahoo. Surely, that would be a slight extra advantage for the top seeds. They can pick a team suffering from injuries -- or a team that they feel like they match up well against. There's also the fun and narrative factor at play when an opponent gets ""called out.""

The reason that I do **not** love this idea though is the unintended consequences. Even if you protect the top 4 seeds (from being called out), you essentially make the difference between the seeds 5, 6, 7, and 8 irrelevant. If our goal is to make seeding matter *more*, then it should apply across the board and not just at the top.

---

**proposal 2: adding extra home games for higher seeds**

Right now, the top seed has home-court advantage -- but really only in Game 7, which amounts to 57% of the series in total. And based on historical data, we only see that decisive Game 7 in about [25%](https://www.nbcsportsboston.com/nba/nba-playoffs-game-7-history-statistics/609963/#:~:text=Postseason%20history%20says%20the%20Finals,38%20Game%207s%20(28.8%25) of all playoff series anyway. It's not as strong of an edge as it is for sports like football.

If want to strengthen the advantage of a top seed, we could go the most extreme and give them home-court advantage for the ENTIRE series. That'd certainly make the seeding matter, huh? But surely, we may be going too far there. Fans (and ticket-hungry owners) of the lower seeded teams may riot.

A potential compromise would be to give the top seed the home-court for 5/7 games -- 71% of the time. The top seed's schedule would look like this:

Game 1: home

Game 2: home

Game 3: away

Game 4: home

Game 5: home

Game 6: away

Game 7: home

Personally, I'd be willing to debate this change, but it's probably too extreme for traditional fans. Moreover, it may be too extreme of an edge -- particularly in certain cases. Even if you advocate for this system, you may want to make exceptions for the 4/5 matchup or for the Finals. Sports is supposed to be a true meritocracy, so we don't want home-court advantage to be *too* hard to overcome.

So how do we strengthen home-court without sacrificing much in terms of history or game flow?

---

**proposal 3: giving the home team the ball to start quarters 2-3-4**

Finally, we arrive on my favorite proposal. 

For the playoffs, the home team starts each quarter (after the first) with possession.

What does that mean exactly? Let's take a step back. In basketball, we have an opening tip-off that's basically ceremonial. Whoever loses the tip-off gets possession to start the next quarter, and the teams rotate. As a result, you get possession at the start of the quarter 2 out of 4 times. Perfectly even. But if we want seeding to matter more, we can't make it ""even."" We have to try and increase the benefit of home-court advantage in small ways.

In this proposed scenario, we'd keep the opening tip-off (which will now actually matter), and then after that, give the home team the possession to start Quarter 2, Quarter 3, Quarter 4. Instead of starting with possession in 2 (of 4) quarters it may be 3 or 4.

I imagine most NBA fans wouldn't even notice the difference. It wouldn't affect the flow of the game. But statistically, it would be meaningful. That extra 1 or 2 possessions would project as an extra 1 or 2 points per game. It'd give the home team more of a baked-in edge. It'd make having home-court matter more. And consequently, it'd make the regular season matter more.","nba",40,"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1khqchf/whats_your_favorite_proposal_to_strengthen/"

OKC destroyed the Nuggets, not through unbelievable offence and the sole efforts of SGA, but rather the combined efforts of Chet, Ihart, Jwill, Dort and SGA.  Their defence was spectacular, and has been all season. Their defence  is the reason that they are the number 1 seed, and by extension of this, the reason why the MVP chants for SGA are louder than they are for Jokic.

Compare that to Denver. Denver ranks far lower on defence. Jokic and what he can do on the other end of the floor, is so powerful, so important, so relevant, that it can power Denver through to playoffs and through entire series.

Its not talked about enough, that OKC's and SGA's success , comes as a result of years of meticulous planning and drafting by one the GOAT front offices. There are sooo many 25-35 ppg players in this league,  and still a few who can play defence. The only reason that SGA is being considered for MVP is simply because his team and its defence.

SGA can have an okay game and the thunder can comfortably win, Jokic must drop a 20 point plus triple double most night for Denver to be a shoe in.

2011 Mavs swept the Lakers, 40ended with the Lakers total collapse in Game 4. This is unexpected, since the Lakers won a championship a year before.

&gt; Calhoun spent 21 seasons in Dallas and was promoted to the head athletic trainer role in 2019. He was one of the final holdovers from the staff of former Mavs director of health and performance Casey Smith, who was fired in August 2023 and hired by the New York Knicks as the vice president of sports medicine last summer.

&gt; Harris hired Belton, a former NFL fullback who had been the director of football performance at UCLA, last summer after firing longtime Mavs athletic performance director Jeremy Holsopple.

&gt; As ESPN reported in April, Belton did not have the certifications from the National Strength and Conditioning Association that the NBA's collective bargaining agreement states are required to be employed as a strength coach for a team.

&gt; Sources told ESPN that there was significant tension between Belton and first-year director of health and performance Johann Bilsborough, who remains employed by the Mavericks. According to multiple team sources, the organization's human relations department investigated a loud, heated verbal confrontation that occurred at the team's practice facility between Belton and Bilsborough.

&gt; That argument stemmed from a disagreement regarding the treatment of Dallas center Dereck Lively II, who went through an intense return-to-play workout under Belton's supervision a day before a CT scan revealed that the big man had a stress fracture in his right ankle, an injury that sidelined him for three months.

&gt; Harrison declined to comment.

"2025-05-09",1746813902,"Oklahoma City's Historic Defense Is A Machine.","When it comes to technology, Apple is the standard. Whether its a computer or an iPhone, they dominate the space. Their products are elegantly designed and highly functionalsleek with a kickass iOS.

Few defenses in NBA history have possessed elite-level hardware and software, and this Oklahoma City team has both!

**Strength. Length. Speed:** All the athletic components needed.

**Processing Speed:** Their individual and collective Intelligence.

Oklahoma City is one of the most intelligent basketball teams in the Modern Era. Rarely do you see them blow a coverage or miss a rotation; their attention to detail in **KYP** is unmatched.

KYP stands for Know Your Personnel:

It's an IF/THEN thought process combining an offensive scouting report and defensive coverages. IF you understand a player's strengths, weaknesses, and tendencies. THEN you can apply the best defensive techniques to combat them. Here's a basic example: Malik Beasley is a better shooter than he is a playmaker, so IF there is a closeout situation with him, THEN the defender should sprint to run him off the line, turning him from a three-point shooter to a driver.

The better the offensive player, the more extensive the KYP thought process can get. For All-NBA-level players, the techniques and schemes needed to have a chance at not being embarrassed by them require all five defenders to be on the same page. Primary defenders have the undesirable job of attempting to force these elite players away from their strengths and towards whatever hint of a weakness exists. At the same time, the other four defenders must know precisely what the primary defender is attempting to do, so they can be in the proper spots to provide immediate help or rotate to help the helper.

Oklahoma City excels in these situations against the NBA elites; all five defenders consistently understand their KYP assignments and execute them flawlessly.

**Athletic Outliers:**

Raw tools such as strength, length, and speed are prerequisites for elite defensive players.

Between Holmgren, Hartenstein, Dort, Williams, and Gilgious-Alexander, Priest has assembled one of the league's biggest and longest starting fives in the league boasting a collective wingspan of thirty-five and a half feet. Thats an average of over seven feet per player.

And that group utilizes all that length to its advantage, generating six steals and five and a half blocks per game. Those 12 opportunities are rocket fuel for their transition offense, creating moments where their collective speed can turn defense into easy baskets.

If that starting five wasnt scary enough, Oklahoma City also has a plethora of chaos agents they can bring in off the bench; Wallace, Joe, and Caruso possess the elite quickness needed to smother ball handlers and get into the passing lanes.

This team is built to get its hands on everything! This season, Oklahoma City generated more deflections and forced more turnovers than any other team in the league. They also scored more points off those turnovers than any other team in the league, turning their defense into an accelerant to ignite their transition offense.

And during their first round sweep of Memphis, it was more of the same: Oklahoma City forced 72 turnovers and scored 54 points off them.

No player embodies this team's defensive intensity quite like Alex Caruso. This season, he averaged a deflection every five and a half minutes, one of the top rates in the league. And so far in the playoffs, hes found another gear, increasing his deflection rate to one every 4 minutes. The guy is absolutely unhinged out there, yet somehow he does it all under control and intelligently.

During the second half of Oklahoma Citys 29-point Game Three comeback, Caruso recorded seven deflections, and Memphis scored an utterly anemic 13 points during his 13-second half minutes.

**The Most Difficult Action To Guard Requires BOTH:**

Pick and roll actions have become the lifeblood of the NBA game, and no action is run more. Second Spectrum categorizes the four core actions of a basketball game as pick-and-roll, handoff, isolation, and post-up. Over 158,145 PnRs were run during this season, and the other three core actions were run for a combined 109,739 times.

OKC was the best team in the NBA this season at guarding the PnR. Almost every other guard on the Oklahoma City roster can occasionally blow up a pick-and-roll. However, exceptional pick-and-roll defense requires all five players to do three things in quick succession:

1. See the same picture. (Quickly--Remember, ""Do your work early.)
2. Communicate. (Clearly--He who talks first controls the actions.)
3. React (With force--Time to put all the athleticism to work.)

Oklahoma City's pick-and-roll defense can check all three boxes: It's a potent mixture of intelligence, athleticism, and attention to detail.

Oklahoma City led the league in pick-and-roll defense, giving up a staggering 94 points for every 100 pick-and-rolls defended. It's a remarkable number when you consider the best pick-and-roll players in the league would score between 115 and 120 points with those same 100 opportunities.

You cant just flip the defensive switch in the playoffs, especially in regards to defending the pick-and-roll; every team must build its Rolodex of habits throughout the 82-game season. That way, when the playoffs come around and everything is faster and more intense, those habits are so ingrained that they turn into instincts.

If you stop to think, Where do I go? What's my next rotation? The offense wins, and your season is over. It's pretty simple.

They consistently do the work early each possession to give themselves the best chance at success. Oklahoma City's habits are as sharp as they come, making their instincts as quick as lightning.

They have an extensive Rolodex, or as the kids would say, *A deep bag,* that they can get to in terms of coverages:

* 9th in Drop (40.4%)
* 14th in Switch (24.75%)
* 18th in Blitz (3.2%)

*Contrast that with teams that have limited PnR defensive profiles and how it leaves them susceptible in bad playoff matchups (Edwards vs. Lakers):*

* *Lakers 1st in Switch (39%) and Last in Blitz (0.96%)*
* *Brooklyn 1st in Blitz (14%) and Last in Drop (20.7%)*

Oklahoma Citys *deep bag* allows them to cover a wide variety of opponents, and they perform all the coverages at an elite level. Theyre a daily fantasy player with a high floor and ceiling, the perfect combination.

Oklahoma City didnt invent a new defense; there's no proverbial smoking gun herejust simple coverages executed at lightning-fast speeds by some of the best athletes in the world.

Is it possible to score on them? Sure, it's possible, but it's certainly not easy. It takes one of two things:

A special effort of individual shot-making efforts: The level of shot-making and individual skill it takes to beat this team does exist. But to beat this team four times would take a historical effort of individual brilliance.

Offensive compounding: No defense can take away everything, although Oklahoma City's defense sometimes makes me question that statement. If an offensive team can string together enough tiny wins within any given possession, they can find their way into semi-open to open shots.

However, as Oklahoma City gets into the later rounds of the playoffs, some teams can bring both elements to the table, as Doncic and Dallas did last season. Denver, Minnesota, Golden State, and Boston all fit the bill. Superstars like Jokic, Edwards, Curry, and Tatum are all capable of the individual brilliance needed, and if they get enough help from their teammates, who knows?","nba",50,"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1kip3fn/oklahoma_citys_historic_defense_is_a_machine/"

It's really jarring and annoying to have such a blast of noise happen over and over throughout a game. I usually end up just muting the audio (which I already do every time Greg Anthony is on the broadcast team anyway, lol). 

This seems like it has to be some manual process from them, because I don't see a way it could be automated (although I'm not 100% sure).

Is there any solution for viewers to level out broadcast audio volume somehow? Is this bothering y'all,  the wider NBA audience?","nba",24,"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1kijecr/weirdawful_change_in_the_tnt_playoff_game_audio/"

"2025-05-09",1746797811,"Despite The Horrendous 3 Point Shooting From the C's, They Are Still Generating Their Most Efficient Shots Due To How Terribly They Are Shooting From Other Locations","Here's a breakdown of shot location and how well they've been shooting from those locations in the 2nd Round:

- Restricted Area: 67.4%
- Paint (Non-Restricted Area): 30.0% (**EFG% of 30%**)
- Mid Range: 27.8%
- Corner 3s: 21.2% (**EFG% of 32%**)
- Above The Break 3's: 25.9%

Despite only shooting 21.2% on Corner 3's, they are more efficient from there than they are anywhere within the arc that isn't the restricted area. And they are **EVEN MORE efficient on Above the Break 3's**. You can argue they should be taking more shots from the restricted area, which like, yes that's what every team is trying to do but also:

- Celtics in the Restricted Area: 21.5 FGA's per game
- Knicks in the Restricted Area: 17.0 FGA's per game

Some other data:

- Cavs are shooting the 2nd most shots in the restricted area on the highest % among all 2nd Round teams and they are down 0-2
- Celtics are averaging 25% from 3 on WIDE OPEN 3's

**Conclusion**

Despite, the topic of shot diet, they are still generating the most efficient shots they can given their shooting percentages from almost everywhere else on the floor. They are already outpacing their opponent in Restricted Area FGA's and when we look at their 2 point shooting from other locations, the efficiency is MORE grim than their 3 point shooting.

It's too late in the game to change their identity, but their identity is still of a team that generates the most efficient looks for itself. If they can just hit their wide open shots, then they'll be fine. If they can't? Then shooting from a different location isn't going to help either.","nba",42,"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1kiiocx/despite_the_horrendous_3_point_shooting_from_the/"

I made a simple study on the stats and details on my blog but I can't post it here because of the self-promotion rules.

Just wanted to discuss this a bit. Can they improve their FT% or that's a lost cause? I get that for instance Zion is not a good shooter so we can't expect him to have a decent FT%, but what about RJ Barrett? Or Sengun who has a reasonable shooting form, and get to the FT line a lot?

Are free-throws really relevant? Is it something more mental than a matter of practice? What do you think? Maybe I'm totally wrong by thinking there's field for improvement here for these players or maybe it's not as important as I think it is.","nba",45,"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1kid55d/can_players_like_giannis_sengun_or_rj_barrett/"

"2025-05-09",1746769643,"The Celtics are the fourth team in NBA history to attempt more 3s than 2s in a season, and by far the most extreme. The 2024-25 Celtics shoot 3s at a 15.3% higher clip than 2s, eclipsing the 2018-19 Rockets by more than 7%","I see many mentions of the Celtics atrocious recent shooting woes, but I have not seen many comparisons of their style to other recent NBA teams and how they are a extreme outlier in terms of 3pt shot attempts. According to my Basketball Reference research the 2024-25 Celtics are only the fourth team with more 3PA than 2PA in a season. I am calling this their *shot preference*. I believe teams with higher 3PT shot preference are doomed to underachieve in the playoffs. The only other teams to ever do this over regular seasons was the Rockets from 2017-2020, and we all know how it ended for them in the playoffs. :

* 2017-18 Rockets: +0.9% 3pt shot preference *(42.3 3PA/g vs 41.9 2PA/g)* 
* 2018-19 Rockets: +8.0% 3pt shot preference *(45.4 3PA/g vs 42.0 2PA/g)*
* 2019-20 Rockets: +0.2% 3pt shot preference *(45.3 3PA/g vs 45.2 2PA/g)*
* 2024-25 Celtics: +15.0% 3pt shot preference *(48.2 3PA/g vs 41.8 2PA/g)*

Players on teams with higher 3PT preference tend float to open space behind the 3PT line instead of cut to space near the basket, because that is what coaches and practice have conditioned them to do. While this proved effective for the Celtics last year, this season they have taken it to the extreme. Last year they had a 2PT preference of 12%, much lower than the league average 2PT preference of 36%. As the title states, this season they now have a 3PT preference of 15.3% the highest of any team in NBA history. 

The more physically and mentally exhausting nature of the playoffs affects some player's focus and flow and inhibits their ability to hit long shots. 3s require touch, focus and finesse not needed to put your head down and drive to the hole for a layup. I think the extra strain of the playoffs combined with the 3PT shot preference is a recipe for bad playoff performances.","nba",18,"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1kib8av/the_celtics_are_the_fourth_team_in_nba_history_to/"

Article text: 

National Basketball Association superstar Russell Westbrook is taking a shot off the court at simplifying funeral planning with artificial intelligence.

The famed Denver Nuggets point guard on Wednesday announced the launch of Eazewell, a startup that uses AI technology to streamline the process for coordinating funerals. Westbrook founded the venture with former Charlotte Hornets star Kemba Walker and childhood friend Donnell Beverly Jr., who serves as president of Russell Westbrook Enterprises and CEO and co-founder of Eazewell.


""My whole career, on and off the court, has been about stepping up decisively in the moments that matter most,"" Westbrook wrote in a statement to CNBC. Westbrook and the Nuggets are currently facing the Oklahoma City Thunder in the NBA Western Conference semifinals. ""Eazewell is exactly that  a decisive solution to a very real problem.""

The Los Angeles-based company uses AI to curate funeral options catered to each user's budgets and preferences. The platform assists with paperwork, budget planning, invitations and overlooked tasks such as canceling a deceased loved one's utility bills and social media accounts. Eazewell currently has 11 employees and has already tested its beta platform with more than 1,000 families. 

Eazewell has not disclosed funding but has revenue agreements with partner services. The startup is also working on partnerships with finance and life insurance companies in the space. The service is free to use and does not have an ads component ""at this stage,"" a company spokesperson said.

""We're trying to take the weight off people's shoulders as much as we can, and make this process so much easier for people,"" Walker told CNBC in a phone interview. Walker played college basketball with Beverly at the University of Connecticut.

Eazewell traces its origins to Westbrook and Beverly's high school days, when their friend and basketball teammate Khelcey Barrs III passed away unexpectedly from an enlarged heart. Westbrook commemorates Barrs to this day by wearing a bracelet with the initials ""KB3"" in every NBA game he plays and on his signature Jordan Why Not Zer0.6 ""Khelcey Barrs"" shoe.

""It's a reminder that life can change in an instant,"" Westbrook said. ""You don't get to choose the moment, but you do get to choose how you respond.""

The experience left a lasting effect on the two friends, Beverly said, but it wasn't until the death of Beverly's parents that he experienced funeral planning hurdles firsthand. Beverly said the experience was ""messy"" and ""grueling.""

Disillusioned and frustrated by the process after the death of his mother and father in 2016 and 2023, respectively, Beverly turned to his close friends to come up with the solution that became Eazewell.

""It just seems like the perfect time to really turn our shared pain into purpose,"" Beverly said.

One of Eazewell's most innovative features is its voice-activated AI agent that can gather cost quotes and call funeral homes on a user's behalf.

Recent advancements in AI have only recently made it possible to automate tasks and create agents that can manage these jobs in an empathetic and compassionate manner, said Viviane Ghaderi, Eazewell's tech chief and a former Amazon executive.

Stephen Stokols, an Eazewell investor and CEO of Tru Skye Ventures, an early-stage sports technology and wellness venture firm, said these ""transformational"" AI advancements helping bring the funeral industry out of the ""dark ages"" initially drew him to the project.

Walker said he hopes Eazewell can offer users the tools to navigate a topic that is not taught in school or early life.

""We know how important it is to have someone by your side to help with the details that come after a loss,"" Westbrook said.

"2025-05-08",1746747564,"Professional Basketball Writers Association relaunches All-Interview Team; Curry, Durant and Antetokounmpo among honorees","May 8, 2025  Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant headline the inaugural NBA All-Interview team, which honors the players who are consistently thoughtful, insightful and engaging with the media, the Professional Basketball Writers Association announced today.

Curry, of the Golden State Warriors, and Durant, of the Phoenix Suns, were the top finishers in a vote of PBWA members and are joined on the 2024-25 All-Interview first team by Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks, Donovan Mitchell of the Cleveland Cavaliers and Draymond Green of the Warriors.

Making the All-Interview second team are Mike Conley Jr. of the Minnesota Timberwolves, Tyrese Haliburton of the Indiana Pacers, Bam Adebayo of the Miami Heat, Josh Hart of the New York Knicks and Damian Lillard of the Bucks.

The All-Interview team, once a staple of the NBAs official slate of awards, was discontinued after the 2003-04 season. The PBWA is bringing it back now, as a way to recognize the players who consistently provide the insights, details and depth that bring our stories to life, while meeting (or exceeding) their mandated media obligations.

Were thrilled to revive the All-Interview team and pleased to have the leagues support in bringing it back, said PBWA president Howard Beck. You cant tell great stories without great interviews. Were truly grateful to the players who make our jobs more enjoyable and our stories more illuminating.

More than four dozen players were nominated by PBWA members. Twenty-five finalists were selected by a PBWA subcommittee to create the official ballot, which was voted on by the entire membership. Players received two points for every first-team vote and one point for every second-team vote.

The other 15 finalists, in alphabetical order, were: Paolo Banchero (Orlando Magic), Cade Cunningham (Detroit Pistons), DeMar DeRozan (Sacramento Kings), Donte DiVincenzo (Minnesota Timberwolves), Anthony Edwards (Minnesota Timberwolves), Rudy Gobert (Minnesota Timberwolves), Al Horford (Boston Celtics), Kyrie Irving (Dallas Mavericks), C.J. McCollum (New Orleans Pelicans), Tyrese Maxey (Philadelphia 76ers), Georges Niang (Cleveland Cavaliers/Atlanta Hawks), Kristaps Porzingis (Boston Celtics), Austin Reaves (Los Angeles Lakers), Fred VanVleet (Houston Rockets) and Victor Wembanyama (San Antonio Spurs).

The All-Interview team joins the PBWAs three longstanding appreciation awards:

 * The Magic Johnson Award, presented annually since 2000-01, honors the NBA player who best combines excellence on the court with cooperation and grace in dealing with the media and fans.

* The Rudy Tomjanovich Award, launched in 2010-11, honors an NBA head coach for his cooperation with the media and fans, as well as his excellence on the court.

 * The Brian McIntyre Award, launched in 2006-07, is presented to the team media-relations staff that best exemplifies standards of professionalism and excellence.

The 2024-25 honorees for all three awards will be announced later this month.

The PBWA is composed of more than 200 writers and editors who cover the NBA regularly for newspapers, magazines and online news outlets.&gt;

Here was OKCs offense in overtime play by play:

- 03:45: J. Williams misses 9' driving floater
- 03:06: J. Williams lost ball turnover
- 03:02: Thunder 60-second timeout

Is it just considered a pass? And the game ended before it was caught?

"2025-05-09",1746825848,"Knicks Defense is being completely downplayed","Throughout the first game, as well as after the game the narrative for this series vs. the Celtics primarily was that they missed wide open or open threes and they just had an off shooting night. Maybe from a tracking or analytics perspective that number makes sense, but if you watch the games itself, these are not open shots MAJORITY of the time. 

Sure the Celtics are also missing some wide open threes that you see on the tape when the defense collapses, but that is not the net variety of what we see. Just because a shot is open does not mean it is not rushed due to a defender closing out from a hedge which we see a lot this series as the Knicks have moved away from drop coverage into full switches with hard hedges from the wings. Tracking data fails to account for if a shot is rushed, if it is a shot in motion of the offense, if its a step back 3 that gives space to make it a open shot but still a guy jumping at you. 

These are what a majority of the Celtics actual looks are, so the knicks deserve more credit on defense, they have held up well.  This was also apparent in the second game, their defense is great on ball on Tatum and Brown even the mismatches with Brown, Brunson made great contests for difficult looks. 

The Knicks also at least in the second game, went down 20 largely due to swings that came from fouls. Some stalled momentum such as the charge that Derrick White took from OG which would have cut the lead to 7 with an and 1, which was actually not a set charge his feet were moving and it swung momentum.

I think the narrative is also very tiring that oh, the celtics just arent playing great but the Knicks are playing their best basketball. It is such a garbage and lazy take that is being spread around the media as well as these subs. Game 2, Brunson had 16 points total and has shot 35% from the field, OG had a stinker, and they actually had their worst offensive rating of any game this season. The Knicks have a lot to improve on offensively as well, and Brunson doesnt have two bad games in a row, it could look very difficult in MSG tomorrow with the momentum going to New York. When will people start to give this Knicks team credit for the defensive presence they are showing, its non stop pressure. I think Knicks win this series ultimately in 6, the Celtics will keep chucking this up to variance, and Mazzulla will not change his analytics.","nba",84,"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1kitrbx/knicks_defense_is_being_completely_downplayed/"

&gt;Over the last 10 years, each team has had an average of 20 Draft selections to make, as every team gets a first and second-round pick annually, which they can either keep or trade away. Given that each team has had a sufficient number of selections, we can fairly evaluate their Draft performance by establishing a few clear rules for this study.

&gt;Whether we look at traditional or advanced stats, the Nets come out as one of the top-performing teams in this analysis. Highlights include Nic Claxton, taken with the 31st pick in 2019, who ranks 3rd in his class by traditional stats and 5th by advanced metrics. Other successful picks include Jarrett Allen (22nd in 2017) and Caris LeVert (20th in 2016).

&gt;Toronto Raptors
For the Raptors, Pascal Siakam (27th pick in 2016) clearly stands out, having developed into one of the best players in his class. Another win was Norman Powell, taken 46th in 2015, who has played over 700 games and had a strong season with the Clippers. OG Anunoby, the 23rd pick in 2017, has also proven to be a steal, developing into a highly valuable 3&amp;D player.

&gt;The Magic have made several lottery picks that didnt pan out. Mario Hezonja, the 5th pick in 2015, averaged just 7 points over five seasons before leaving the league. Jett Howard, 11th in 2023, has averaged under 10 minutes per game over his first two seasons. Other questionable picks include Anthony Black, Mo Bamba, and Jonathan Isaac, all chosen 6th in their respective Draft years (2023, 2018, and 2017).","nba",27,"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1kistbl/how_do_nba_franchises_perform_in_the_draft/"

"2025-05-09",1746819926,"2025 NBA Playoffs - Who are you hoping to see win it all?","I am praying to the basketball gods that OKC gets eliminated from the playoffs. Despite there being aspects I like about them as a team (I adore Chet Holgrom, and their team first mentality is admirable) I just can't stand the idea of them winning a championship without there being a Seattle Supersonics (I used to live in Seattle).

**Who I want to see win:**

**1) New York Knicks**: even though I hate their owner because he's greedy AF and doesn't support the WNBA, I want to see the hard work and dedication of Tom Thibodeau finally payoff in the form of a championship. I'm growing to really like them as a team even though they beat my Detroit Pistons.

**2) Golden State Warriors** \- I don't think this is likely if Curry isn't healthy, but I want to see their legacy go out with a bang and for Playoff Jimmy to get his ring once and for all.

**3) Indiana Pacers** \- I'm a Midwesterner gal and I just love Tyrese Halliburton. The Pacers first championship would be sweet; it's too bad Reggie Miller won't be broadcasting but I'm sure he'd be there to watch.

**4) Cleveland Cavaliers** \- again, midwestern team and how amazing would it be for them to win it without LeBron.

**5) Nuggets -** Jokic deserves another ring.

**6) Minnesota Timberwolves** \- I love Anthony Edwards and I watched his victory lap a million times and cracked up every time. I do really like them but not this year.

Please NO CELTICS vs THUNDER  - I'd root for the C's but I would be disappointed with this matchup","nba",90,"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1kirfrc/2025_nba_playoffs_who_are_you_hoping_to_see_win/"

"2025-05-09",1746816874,"How to beat the Nuggets easily. Attack Michael Porter Jr on defense. Help off MPJ on offense since he cannot drive.","Michael Porter Jr is easily exploitable. OKC learned from Game 1. The game is pretty easy, and OKC made the game 5v4 where MPJ becomes invisible.

1. [MPJ helps off Chet Holmgren](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;GameEventID=14&amp;GameID=0042400222&amp;Season=2024-25&amp;flag=1&amp;title=MISS%20Holmgren%2026%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot) \- does not put his hands up to deflect passes - just good offense by OKC to pass to MPJ's man
2. [MPJ just stands around like a scare crow on offense](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;GameEventID=12&amp;GameID=0042400222&amp;Season=2024-25&amp;flag=1&amp;title=MISS%20Murray%2015%27%20Turnaround%20Fadeaway%20Shot). You don't need to worry about MPJ crashing glass. Murray shoots a tough shot.
3. [MPJ just confused](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;GameEventID=18&amp;GameID=0042400222&amp;Season=2024-25&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Hartenstein%203%27%20Alley%20Oop%20Dunk%20(2%20PTS)%20(Holmgren%201%20AST)). He should've went back to Chet as Braun recovered. He just stands like a cone. Easy bucket. Keep attacking MPJ.
4. [No one ran back.](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;GameEventID=22&amp;GameID=0042400222&amp;Season=2024-25&amp;flag=1&amp;title=MISS%20Dort%206%27%20Running%20Layup) Not even MPJ. Easy bucket.
5. [MPJ is a cone. ](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;GameEventID=36&amp;GameID=0042400222&amp;Season=2024-25&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Hartenstein%2011%27%20Floating%20Jump%20Shot%20(4%20PTS)%20(Jal.%20Williams%201%20AST))Does not use his hands at all. They pass right to Hartenstein who is he right next to. He is completely ineffective as a help defender.
6. [MPJ is a cone again.](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;GameEventID=40&amp;GameID=0042400222&amp;Season=2024-25&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Jal.%20Williams%205%27%20Cutting%20Dunk%20Shot%20(4%20PTS)%20(Hartenstein%202%20AST)) Hands are always down. Does not try to block passing lanes. Just a cone.
7. This is just bad. [MPJ should've switched onto Hartenstein](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;GameEventID=44&amp;GameID=0042400222&amp;Season=2024-25&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Hartenstein%2013%27%20Floating%20Jump%20Shot%20(6%20PTS)%20(Gilgeous-Alexander%201%20AST)). Jokic would've covered the rim. MPJ is a cone.
8. [MPJ is a cone. ](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;GameEventID=79&amp;GameID=0042400222&amp;Season=2024-25&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Gilgeous-Alexander%2019%27%20Step%20Back%20Jump%20Shot%20(6%20PTS))He just has his hands at his side. What is the point of his defense on this? He should be contesting SGA shot and forcing a pass. He just stands there like a cone.
9. [MPJ sagging off but does not help on the drive.](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;GameEventID=172&amp;GameID=0042400222&amp;Season=2024-25&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Jal.%20Williams%2010%27%20Driving%20Floating%20Jump%20Shot%20(8%20PTS)) MPJ Cone
10. [MPJ does not box out IHart ](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;GameEventID=287&amp;GameID=0042400222&amp;Season=2024-25&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Hartenstein%203%27%20Tip%20Layup%20Shot%20(8%20PTS))\- easy tip for a score. This man does not use his hands at all.
11. [MPJ does nothing on offense](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;GameEventID=290&amp;GameID=0042400222&amp;Season=2024-25&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Jal.%20Williams%204%27%20Running%20Alley%20Oop%20Dunk%20Shot%20(12%20PTS)%20(Gilgeous-Alexander%207%20AST)) and does not run back on defense
12. [MPJ rocked on a box out](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;GameEventID=295&amp;GameID=0042400222&amp;Season=2024-25&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Gilgeous-Alexander%2013%27%20Pullup%20Jump%20Shot%20(18%20PTS)) by Dort

MPJ is a negative player right now. His shoulder is hurt. He gives no effort. 

He either needs to wear a mouth guard and fight through the pain and give effort or just be benched.

If I was OKC, I would do the same thing. Play with high effort and physicality and just attack MPJ.","nba",154,"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1kiq96s/how_to_beat_the_nuggets_easily_attack_michael/"

Minneapolis-St. Paul - The following is a statement from the Minnesota Timberwolves regarding last night's (May 8) fan ejection:

""During the fourth quarter of last night's game against the Warriors, a fan was ejected by Target Center security for violating the NBA Fan Code of Conduct in an incident involving Draymond Green. A second individual, who was identified by surrounding patrons as making racially charged comments towards Green, left on his own before arena security could confirm his identity. The team is continuing to investigate, and additional action may be taken.

The Timberwolves and Target Center are firmly committed to fostering an inclusive, respectful, and safe environment for all. Racist, hateful, or threatening behavior has no place at our games or in our community and will not be tolerated under any circumstances.""

Or, is started who is only brought in for their defense but isn't relied upon to score practically any night. Your Moses Moodys, your Jared Vanderbilts or Hardaway Jr. (I am not saying these guys are the worst necessarily)

Contrast this with being the best bench player, who typically comes in when your Superstar player is resting. This player has an entirely different responsibility placed on his shoulders, and typically is expected to perform at a high level AND score. Pritchard, maybe McBride, Naz Reid, guys like that.

As a Knicks fan, I am a Thibs loyalist. He got a mid 2020 Knicks team into the playoffs with HCA. a team that won like 19 games the previous season. That alone makes him legendary for me and I trust his judgement. However, among Knicks fans there is a huge number of us that want Thibs gone and believe that in order for us to reach title aspirations, we need to get a better coach. 

Many thought that if we were embarrassed by Boston in 4 or 5 games, That Thibs would get fired. 

The main qualms with him are his minutes distributions, and also some questionable play calls at the end of games. As well as just a general failure to compete with the upper end teams during the regular season. Not to mention the lack of game time for draft picks. 

If the Knicks fail to get to the ECF (or even Finals), should the Knicks fire Thibs? Why or why not? 

And who would you replace thibs with? The roster clearly has a championship caliber starting 5. But the bench is where questions arise. ","nba",76,"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1kjgidz/how_safe_is_thibs_job_with_the_knicks/"

"2025-05-10",1746897070,"Former Dallas mayor: ""Dallas fans deserve better than a billionaire owner more focused on lobbying for casino legislation than protecting the franchise.""","""... And as a capper, Harrison recently said publicly, I did know that Luka was important to the fanbase, I didnt quite know to what level. Really? Thats not a credible thing for the GM of a major sports franchise to say.

For me, having led this city, I think this comes down to the importance of engaged and committed local ownership in our sports franchises. What Ive seen since Patrick Dumont and the Adelson family took over the Mavs suggests a lack of interest in the basketball operations and this community. From where I sit, the priority is clear: use this asset to further the familys casino business,

Dumont approved a trade that its hard to believe any local owner would have accepted; it gutted the teams identity and shattered a deep bond with its fans. It was apathy or a lack of understanding about Luka and the Dallas fan base that gave Harrison the authority to carry out his trade plan  regardless of the damage done.

Absenteeism has cost Dallas dearly. Hopefully, our public officials will remember this when the prospect of gambling is next raised.

Mark Cuban, over his decades of ownership, brought a passion for basketball and commitment to our community. I can only wonder what his reaction is in hindsight to selling the team to out of town owners who havent reflected his commitment. There is no question it will affect his legacy.

Dallas fans deserve better than a front office more loyal to its industry contacts than its players. They deserve better than a billionaire owner more focused on lobbying for casino legislation than protecting the franchise.

Above all, they deserve accountability. Fans invest their time, their money and their belief in these teams. That investment deserves reciprocation. When you are the steward of a sports franchise, you are a steward of public trust.

This wasnt just a bad trade. It was a betrayal and a violation of that trust. It should be hard to earn back.""

The team usually has great depth and racks up wins, but when the playoffs come around, that depth doesn't matter as much. Rotations shrink to seven or eight guys, and the postseason becomes about star power, experience, and execution. That's when the overhyped team often gets exposed by a more battle-tested group led by an elite playoff performer.

This is the pattern I see with teams like OKC. Not that they can't win  but they're rarely as dominant in the playoffs as people expect based on their regular-season success. And somehow, we all forget this lesson every year and have to relearn it come May and June.

Teams like last years Celtics dont fall into this category. They dominate the regular season and have playoff experience. They're built for both

I think it's still important to be clear that he's been legitimately not good over his last six games and the Nuggets are finding ways to win anyway. He's had four bad showings, and the Nuggets have won three of them!

Game 5 vs. LAC: 13/10/12 on 43%TS - Nuggets win by 16

Game 3 vs. OKC: 20/16/6 with 8 turnovers on 37%TS - Nuggets win by 9 (OT)

This is pretty remarkable and a clear indicator that this Denver roster is legit. All year we've heard the Nuggets had a terrible supporting cast but that's not the case. 

Over the last six games: 

Jamal Murray: 24/5/5 on 50/43/84 splits, 58%TS

Aaron Gordon: 20/7/3 on 52/42/96 splits, 64%TS, and *by far* the clutchest player this playoffs

Russell Westbrook: 16/3/4 in just 27mpg on 50/37/71 splits, 61%TS

Christian Braun: 11/7/2 on 50/40/60 splits, 60%TS

Peyton Watson's on 72%TS, Michael Porter Jr.'s on 57%TS through a shoulder injury, etc.

My answer is... **SPURS**

If they need a second star, they could potentially trade fox and other assets.

If there will be a new dynasty in 2030s. I think it will be the SAS.

I've decided to translate this article (by myself), from Hebrew to English, by myself, for Mother's Day.  
[The article (in Hebrew) - via Sport5](https://nba.sport5.co.il/articles.aspx?FolderID=403&amp;docID=505727)

Title: ""I never dared to dream that my son would become the king of New York""

Description: ""On Mother's Day in the USA, Jalen Brunson's mother shares an exclusive interview with the sport's channel."" (that's also another name for Sport5)

The article:

&gt;After the New York Knicks' loss to Boston in Game 3 last night (Saturday) and before Game 4 between Monday and Tuesday, the Big Apples star Jalen Brunson has time to spend with his family and recharge himself with some new energies, which might help him lead his team to a stunning 3-1 lead. In honor of Mothers Day, celebrated today in the United States, Brunsons mother, **Sandra**, spoke with the sports channel about her bond with her son, her role in his success, and his dream.

&gt;It feels amazing to be the mom of an NBA superstar; its a blessing. I know how hard Jalen worked for this, how much he sacrificed, and its fun for me to see him living his dream, Sandra says. At the same time, our relationship is very public, so I have to be careful when Im cheering in the stands.

&gt;My role in Jalens success? I always reminded him to stay humble, keep his feet on the ground after successes and failures, push his teammates, and never take anything for granted. I leave all the professional stuff to his dad.

&gt;Today, Jalen doesnt consult me before games, but I always tell him how proud I am of him. After losses, I send him an encouraging message, and after wins, we talk more. He just needs me in the role of mom.

&gt;Brunson, as is well known, has become a superstar with the Knicks, which means shining on the biggest stageNew York. Sandra: I cant wrap my head around the fact that my son is the king of New York, especially as someone who grew up in New York. I hear people say it, and its not something I take for granted; its a huge compliment.

&gt;At the same time, I know Jalen and the Knicks have a lot of work ahead of them, so I try not to get too caught up in the frenzy. Its really exciting for me to see all the fans in New York wearing his jersey, and as someone who grew up hereeven in my wildest dreams, I never imagined something like this.

&gt;Sandra shared about Jalens development as a basketball player: I believe mothers and parents in general should let their kids lead them, not the other way around. I let my kids choose their sport during childhood, but it was important to me and Rick that they grow up with some kind of sport, because theres no substitute for the qualities you develop as a young athlete, especially in a team sport.

&gt;I know its tough to support your kids after work hours and that some sports and activities cost a lot of money, but my advice to parents is that if your child really wants to play a sport, go with it and help them grow as they get older, because it can lead to so much more. I volunteered for Jalen.

&gt;What do I wish for myself on Mothers Day? To be with my family, with my granddaughter (Jalens daughter), and I want everyone to smile and enjoy being together, she concluded.

"2025-05-11",1746984965,"Is it possible to have 30 points on 61% shooting, 6 rebounds, with 2 blocks  and not have a great game?","I believe Kuminga had one of the most interesting games, and the ensuing discourse about his performance highlights the disparity in how different fan segments evaluate a players performance. If we solely rely on the stat sheet, which many fans consider the sole indicator of a great game, the notion of Kumingas performance being lackluster seems absurd. He scored numerous points without taking many shots, and his contributions ignited an offensive spark for a team that desperately needed it during Game 2 and especially Game 3.

Kuminga had 30,6, and 2 blocks on 61% shooting in 36 minutes. At the same time, Kuminga had a crucial stretch towards the end of the game where he contributed to the Wolves being able to seal the victory. Kuminga made the opposite of winning plays.

A slew of terrible decisions by Kuminga transpired. The decision to shoot contested shots over traffic instead of passing the ball, fell right into what the Wolves wanted late in the game. Kuminga took a 9-foot turnaround fadeaway at 3:02 and an 11-foot floater at 2:16, points where the Warriors needed a basket. 

Despite his scoring, Kuminga essentially took the game into a 2 v 5 and focused significantly more on just getting his points even at the detriment of being a black hole more so than balancing that with occasionally creating opportunities for teammates other than Jimmy, essentially disrupting any possibility of trying to engineer an offensive flow. Kuminga needed a big offensive game and needed to score a lot just for the Warriors to have a chance, I dont contest that but, there were several times he couldve contributed to an extra pass and get his teammates involved.

Onto the numerous defensive lapses. It is not a secret that defense has been an area for Kuminga to improve since he entered the league. Jonathan has incredible potential but, I also think thats what makes it so frustrating is how atrocious his effort can be and how sometimes he genuinely looks lost as to what his defensive assignments are. 

Towards the end of the third, and the top of the 4th, Warriors had a chance to extend their lead but Kuminga allows a routine blow by, for whatever reason, allowing Ant to go inside to the paint with no resistance for an easy basket. Kuminga then gets blown by by Divencenzo to the bucket which leads to the team crashing the paint to stop the layup which leads to kick outs eventually to an Edwards 3. 

The bucket at the 7:10 mark just after the Warriors lead 82-77 will get pinned on Draymond for going for the steal but Kuminga is also super late rotate over and react and knowing your personnel should tell Julius is not kicking it out to the corner and even if he does, Jimmy rotates to McDaniels.

Theres a lot of little defensive intricacies and nuances which matter so much in a tight playoff game and you dont have to be perfect but these lapses are sometimes the differences between wins and losses.

While Kumingas stat line paints the picture of a breakout performance, the full context tells a more complicated story. His offensive surge helped spark momentum, but his decision-making down the stretch and persistent defensive lapses undermined that impact when it mattered most. 

Evaluating a great game should require more than just efficiency and counting stats. Not saying it shouldnt be factored at all but there might be more to it than for that to just be the end all be all. Its just interesting because theres a lot of players who have an inefficient scoring output and the score box isnt the sexiest but they make all the little plays and contribute to their team winning but a large sector of fans will say they had a bad game.

"2025-05-11",1746977311,"Draft Lottery is Tomorrow: Here are the predetermined ""fixes"" for each team","With the draft lottery tomorrow, the fans of teams who didn't make the post-season have their favourite year-end event: the draft lottery

Every time the draft lottery is held, we begin to hear suggestions that it was fixed/rigged, with proof! What proof will there be this year? Below are all potential proofs lottery conspiracy theorists may come up with for why Flagg was always destined to go to the lottery winners.

**Utah Jazz**: White.

**Washington Wizards**  - On October 21st, 2024 Wizards owner Ted Leonsis suddenly announced he had entered an agreement to keep the Wizards in DC, ending chatter about a move to Virginia. Agreement promised a new stadium renovation, and that the team could not consider relocation until 2045. Why the sudden change from Leonsis? He must've been promised the rights to Cooper Flagg of course. Not to mention someone named Flagg playing for the nation's capital? Too obvious.

**Charlotte Hornets**: LaMelo is one of the most popular young players in the league, leading the East backcourt in All-Star votes. Play seems rather obvious here. Pair him with Flagg and you've given Gen Z its team. Plus, the Hornets were sold in summer 2023. New ownership didnt care about the shitty 2024 draft though, so the league mustve promised them the #1 pick in 2025 of course.

**New Orleans Pelicans**: We saw how much attention the Pelicans and Zion got when he was a rookie. He needs a partner in crime. Who better than another 'generational' Duke prospect in Flagg?

**Philadelphia 76ers**: Philly is a massive market, with one of the most talked-about superstars in the league in Joel Embiid. The franchise is on life support right now, and the NBA doesn't want to lose out - giving them Flagg would fix this.  

**Brooklyn Nets**: The Nets reside in the biggest market in the league, yet they haven't quite shed the Knicks' little brother label. Giving them Flagg could change things.

**Toronto Raptors**: With the lottery being rigged every year, the NBA needs to throw in curveballs here and there to throw fans off the scent. Cant rig it every year, itd be too obvious. Give Flagg to the Raptors to accomplish this.

**San Antonio Spurs**: The league wants Wemby to be the face of the league, and he cant be the face of the league with a middling roster. Give him another stud to pair with Fox and let the ratings flow in.

**Houston Rockets (PHX unprotected pick)**: Houston is a *huge* market on the brink of a dynasty. We just saw how great they performed in the playoffs. Adding Flagg to that high-flying (and Sengun) core is guaranteed ratings, and also ensures a great environment for Flagg to grow and develop into the modern American superstar the NBA needs. Combine that with the built-in China market from Yao, and a successful franchise in Houston would only be a positive for the league.

**Portland Trail Blazers**: Portland refused to tank this year, going on a meaningless run at the end of the season. NBA wants to send a message to the likes of Utah and Washington that tanking wont help, so they give Flagg to Portland.

**Dallas Mavericks**: Self explanatory. We all know whats going on here&

**Chicago Bulls**: Chicago is an absolutely massive market thats been struggling. The NBA is simply a better place when Chicago is good. Easy decision to send Flagg here

**Sacramento Kings**: The Kings just months ago sent their franchise player, DeAaron Fox, to the Spurs to play with Wemby, and received a pittance in return. Why would they do that???

Interesting. Hopefully we get to see more of this after Ant has his way. I'd love to see one more Curry-Bron.

(No agenda here, there are a million ways to slice ""clutch"" stats, I thought this was was best as it is officially agreed upon and produces a really good sample size, but I'm sure changing even one of the parameters slightly would sway the results heavily). Especially ignore steals and blocks data... the sample size there seems iffy, and they are never a good indicator of defense as we know anyways.

Interesting fact: LeBron was, by this metric, best in the clutch in his first Cavs stint, and it isn't really close. Figured that's kind of cool.

Edit: just to be clear, this includes ALL of their careers. LeBron starting in 2006 w/ his first playoff run, up until this year's series against the Wolves. Curry from '13 (his first playoff run) to now. Durant as well. So this includes their younger, less experienced years.","nba",15,"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1kk1och/clutch_playoff_stats_for_lebron_curry_kevin/"

Jokic would have two titles, potentially another Finals MVP, and continue to solidify himself as one of the greatest centers of all timemaybe even challenging the top 5 big men conversation. His advanced metrics are already off the charts, and a second ring would erase any lingering doubts about his playoff resume.

Curry, on the other hand, would be adding a fifth ring, something only a few players in NBA history have achieved. Hed match Kobe in championships, potentially pass Magic in some eyes, and further cement his status as the greatest shooter and a transformative figure in the modern NBA.

So whats the bigger legacy leap: Jokic climbing into the upper echelon of all-time greats, or Curry pushing himself into the rarest air of NBA history?

It seems a glock should just cover all the bases, but some of my military friends have recommended an m14, or a remmington shotty. I have a loved one that I am marrying next year, and while we are both US born citizens, we are getting worried about where things are going (some have said similarly to Germany 1939) I don't have a lot of money, but it is something that is on my mind. California native. I only need something for an emergency that I pray to god will never happen.

Used to have a Ruger .22 and used to have a Remington. I know ammo type is very important as well. I am asking as someone who is worried about criminals entering my home. Any advice anyone could provide? Money is tight, but I'm a semi-crack shot. Please let me know if I haven't followed the rules, I will modify this post if that is the case.

Sorry, I'm scared and am half-french, so I'm genetically predisposed to be concerned about tyranny

ed: If you do keep a bat by your door, go with a women's softball bat. Agile and easy to use in small areas. Also, put a sock over the bat. If the intruder tries to grab your bat, it will just slip off in their hands. I make my own decorative home defense tools (non-lethal). I paint birds on hatchets, and the ol' skull and bones on my bats. Just non lethal advice for anyone who hasn't heard this. Love you guys for the info

The range called everyone who has qualified with a P320 last Friday night and told them that as of immediately the P320 is ""No longer considered safe for Duty or Backup carry"". The Range staff said they were able to replicate malfunctions that caused a discharge without a finger on the trigger. They did say that they are in talks with Sig, and if they can devise a fix they'll reevaluate the gun. This decision did not include the p365 which is still on the approved weapons list. 

  
This is frustrating for me because I finally traded up for a P320 and it's a champ, and now it's a paperweight. I like the way it fits my hand, the low recoil, the accuracy... everything. It came out of the box feeling as broken in as my last pistol took five years to get to.

I would love to take him to the range again after such a long time. The only problem is he's wearing hearing aids on both sides (the type that hooks on to your ear).

What would be the best way to use ear pro for him? Giant-cup-type over the hearing aids? Is there any ear pro specifically designed to work together with hearing aids?

What exactly is a Mini-ACOG mount? From what I can tell, it's the interface connection between the optic and the optic mount which then connects to the actual firearm, most commonly via picatinny rail. 

Is there a large market of optics that have Mini-ACOG mounts?

I'm planning on getting my first rifle soon, a Mini-14, and came across this [stripper clip guide + 3x MicroPrism mount from Cogburn Arsenal](https://cogburnarsenal.com/product/mini-14-30-3x-microprism-mount-582-or-higher/). I love the idea of having the option to reload via stripper clips like an old bolt action or SKS so I'm pretty dead set on getting it. The issue is that the description says that it uses a mini-ACOG mount, but is designed exclusively to work with the PA 3x MicroPrism. But if the scope mounts via Mini-ACOG, wouldn't any scope that has Mini-ACOG mounts be able to mount to it?

I know that the people that would know the most are the folks at Cogburn, and I sent them an email but they've yet to reply.","guns",3,"https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/1jyxbwf/what_is_a_miniacog_mount_are_there_a_lot_of_optic/"

"2025-04-13",1744578172,"Range USA - first time back in 3years. >. >. >.","This is gonna be a book. TLDR this place is HORRIBLE. 

Stopped going a few years ago when they wanted either $75 or $100 for a transfer (forget the exact number but it was stupid regardless).  Use a local FLL for that now &amp; any fun smithing- good dudes. Started shooting at outdoor ranges after that. Figured its their business they want to run their way- I just made the choice I wasnt going out of my way to give them more business& didnt seem community friendly. 

Ive been craving a new carry gun and I went to shoot some side by side & I should have trusted my spidey senses but I had time to kill. First I went to the kiosk to fill out a waiver (signage saying you need one every year). While Im filling it out I was chit chatting the clerk at the rental booth asking if they had any VP9Ks or shadow 2 compacts available to rent. He asked me if the VP9 was the Glock thing- I  told him HK and he immediately said no. I got up to the counter to see what was available- its 90% sig, Glock, and springfield& only thing I was semi interested in comparing against those two was a PDP compact so I asked for that. The clerk put his hand on top of a sticker they have on the glass while shaking his head- it says something like first time guests are not allowed to rent guns. I said something to the extent of I used to shoot here every week for a few years, this is just my first waiver in over a year& he seemed skeptical and said yeah I understand buuu or something like that, but then I told him I shoot IDPA and I promise I wont cause a headache- so I was able to slip passed that gate keeper. I asked if I could swap out whatever I was shooting back at the rental booth. He proudly said nope, that requires a membership! So aside from paying for range time, targets and ammo at all inflated prices( plus some shake down first time in a year fee), I had to pay 20$ per gun for any gun I wanted to shoot. The total rang up to $140~. I almost walked out& I intended to come buy 4 boxes of ammo and shoot 2-4 guns that I may turn around and buy afterwards. Already planned a trip with the wife, dropped her off shopping and this was my thing to kill time with& so against my better judgement I said fuck it and checked out, regretting it not long after. Not even ragging on 2x ROs standing behind me the whole time, I understand they cater to the general public and what that means. 

IMO, Range USA is ONLY interested inshort term profits. Why would gun guys ever want to go there? Im a capitalist, so Im not saying making money is bad or they shouldnt make a ton of money- they should. That said, my previous avoidance of Range USA turned into an actual boycott. Done and telling everyone in the area I live that shoots how horrible a value it is. Not interested in business that nickel and dime. 

Shitty rental selection too. Anyways. Rant over. Had to bitch to the ether.

Edit: only bought 2 boxes of ammo& wasnt gonna spend an additional $20/ gun after I shot the PDP and didnt see anything else not Springfield, Glock or sig lol.

The top cartridges that I'm considering are 8x57 mm IS Mauser, 7x57 mm Mauser, and .308 Winchester. 

The 8mm IS Mauser strong points: should have minimum losses out of a 18"" (457.2mm) length barrel due to the usage of faster burning powders, the receivers feed lips are already machined for it, surplus ammunition is still available, and I don't have one. Weak points: not the most abundant abundant ammo and reloading components, minimum muzzle threads are M15x1 mm with 5/8""-24 TPI or M16x1 mm being better, harder to find muzzle devices (ie flash hiders, muzzle brakes and sound suppressors) must be .338"" (8.6 mm) or bigger, surplus ammunition has croosive primers, berdan primed, and might need a powder swap. 

7x57 mm Mauser's strong points: 7mm bullets are easier to find, is somewhat more popular, can use 9/16""-24 TPI muzzle threads, can use .30 cal muzzle devices. Weak points: loaded ammunition isn't the cheapest, brass isn't the most common, most 7mm bullets are optimized for faster cartridges, slower burning powders requires a longer barrel especially with the lower pressures when compared to newer cartridges, I already have one a 93 Mauser. 

.308 Winchester's strong points: it's currently one of the most abundant cartridges out there in terms of factory ammo and reloading components, makes the rifle a true scout. Muzzle devices are plentiful. Weak points: wasted cartridge overall length .308 maximum COL 2.815""(71.5 mm) vs 7x57 mm Mausers 3.065"" (77.85 mm) and 8x57 IS Mausers 3.25"" (82.55 mm) which ,in order is a loss of 0.435""(11.05 mm) , 0.185""(4.7 mm), which requires a magazine spacer, I already have one, Remington 788. 

There are other cartridges but they have their own issues, 30-06 (feed lip, feed ramp and magazine modification, longer barrer, already have in a 1903 Springfield), 6.5 mm Creedmore(Slow powders, .308 Winchester spacer), .257 Roberts +P and 6mm Remington (Scarcity, Max cartridge length is knee capped to fit short actions).

"2025-04-13",1744558468,"Burris XTR Pro Review","#[Introduction](https://i.imgur.com/1crTeXi.jpg)

Finally! I got rid of [that MK4HD](https://www.reddit.com/r/longrange/comments/1eqfcqq/trollygags_review_of_the_leupold_mk4hd_vs_meopta/). Blessed be he who made the sacrifice and took it as his own.

So I took the proceeds from the sale and immediately bought something else.

Enter - the XTR Pro

I'm not going to sugar-coat it. Spoilers:

&gt;!The XTR Pro is the MK5HD if Leupold had any fucking clue what they were doing.!&lt;

#Overview

The XTR Pro is a full-featured, even hyper-featured scope - meaning it has above-standard features.

* [MADE IN USA. Can you believe it???](https://i.imgur.com/qLgoAnv.jpg)

* DUAL illumination. There is a red diode and a green diode so that it can project red or green illum onto the reticle. AFAIK, no NV illum like the ZCOs have, but still pretty dang cool.

* Tool-less stopped elevation. No locking elevation, but a lot of people don't want this as a feature anyways.

* Optionally capped windage. There is both an exposed windage and a capped windage turret so if you want to dial on wind, you can do so, and if you want to protect windage, you can do that too. Very cool and useful feature given how particular people are on this.

* Custom ranging/writeable turret, and clear marking turret. Comes with two elevation turrets to cover both use cases for hunters and target/competition shooters.

* Light weight - 30x top end and comparable (35 vs 33oz) to the sim-to MK5HD 7-35x. 

* 5.5x erector multiplier

* Close range parallax

* 56mm objective, 34mm tube. 

* 12!!! mil turrets

* Throw lever included. Sunshade included.

# Controls

###[Turrets](https://youtube.com/shorts/2C6AngQlCEA)

Elevation turret is medium tactile, overdamped, heavy-weight. Mine out of the box had a different feel going up vs going down - I assume this will even out over time. Windage turret is medium tactile, less overdamped, medium weight.  Other controls are pretty stiff.

Knurling isn't as aggressive or grippy as many other scopes. The hex pattern is cool and they are aggressively raised, but it doesn't have the same bite as ones with vertical knurling. 

I definitely felt the need to have the [throw lever on the magnification ring](https://i.imgur.com/SzXk7lK.jpg), but it was a pain to put on so I left it off. 

[The markings are crystal clear - easily readable, bright matte white font on a flat scope - no interference from glare or the measurements blending in. ](https://i.imgur.com/t9b5Jud.jpg)

[The Zero Stop](https://i.imgur.com/JYNIvoX.jpg) and cap switching mechanism is super cool and easy to use, with nice seals. 

The illum battery cap is the kind where you keep turning past the end of adjustment to loosen. Feels sketchy the first time you do it, but it is fine. 

# Glass 

Here's the important part. The glass is shockingly similar to the MK4/MK5HD line of optics, but with less CA and I believe better color and contrast by a bit. Resolution tested to be pretty simlar to the Optika6. 

It does have more CA than optics that I tend to be attracted to - and I would consider this to be a mild-medium ED glass optic. 

* [XTR Pro test target](https://i.imgur.com/bX1fuY2.jpg)
* [Optika6 test target](https://i.imgur.com/wrmgbXo.jpg)
* [Razor III test target](https://i.imgur.com/sjBqETd.jpg)

You can plainly see the difference there.

Here's an interesting one:

* [Razor III anti reflective coatings](https://i.imgur.com/zhhJn1G.jpg)
* [Razor III light baffling](https://i.imgur.com/zhhJn1G.jpg)
* [XTR Pro anti reflective coatings](https://i.imgur.com/hUI7rfQ.jpg)
* [XTR Pro light baffling](https://i.imgur.com/hQxVVbS.jpg)

I think there's a couple points to observe here. One - classic blue vs green anti-reflective coating choice. Typically, more expensive coatings are tuned towards blue. The Razor has a brighter reflection on the objective, indicating its anti-reflective coatings are not as performant. 

As such, the XTR Pro glass looks more transparent. That's good.

Also to note, the light baffling is much more visible in the XTR Pro. This is good - means more light is getting through the glass. The downside is that the light baffling has to work harder to cut down glare. The point of the light baffles is that light coming in hitting the edges of the scope aren't reflecting down the scope tube toward your eye. 

Ideally, they would absorb the light and convert to heat as this would prevent the reflection off the baffling from striking the objective and getting back to your eye.

* [Near field/DOF test](https://i.imgur.com/qohuJW2.jpg)
* [Lower magnification environment shot](https://i.imgur.com/y5p5fOI.jpg) - Image presentation is excellent, eyeguides are okay, reticle has vanished.
* [Max magnification](https://i.imgur.com/usPggno.jpg) on limbs. The reticle is still very fine and difficult to pick up without illum on. The MK5 had the same issue - but unlike the MK5, this optic has illum available at a lower price point. 


* [RIII on tree trunk and sun](https://i.imgur.com/JBS4vKT.jpg)
* [O6 on the same target](https://i.imgur.com/IGXI0dK.jpg)
* [XTR Pro on the same target](https://i.imgur.com/mNx8LgC.jpg)

Resolution is A tier. Color/contrast is A tier. CA performance is B tier. 

## Illumination

[Illum is good](https://i.imgur.com/VCR2XIn.jpg). Bright at the bright, dual colors. A little bleed on the numbers, but not too bad. 

Here's a cool shot on how dual illum works. Zoomed out at at high brightness on a dark background, you can see the projectors. 

[Here is red](https://i.imgur.com/K4bqqBq.jpg) and [Here is green](https://i.imgur.com/zOfrGMt.jpg).

I really want to turn both on at once and make yellow. That'd be sick. 

## Conclusion

This optic has many strong points. It does everything the MK5HD does without the stupid turrets or features or markings, but also made in USA and at the same weight. 

It comes standard with things the MK5HD should have but didn't.

It comes in a magnification range that the MK5HD should have but didn't. 

If you were looking for a Leupy MK5HD based on its weight specs, and aren't getting it more than half off because of some cert or deal, then this is what you should be buying. 

### What else?

But how does it stand on its own? Well - the glass is what you would expect at the price point. It doesn't punch up, it doesn't punch down. The features are better than what you would expect at its price point - feature rich and capable. 

I would consider it more of a benchmark buy than a value buy. 

That is why this review seems a bit... dry and clinical. I don't have any really strong opinions about it because it is... what you would expect from it. 

If you want the features, which are competition oriented and make the scope flexible in role, buy it.

If you want really high quality LR target/gamer scope, save up a little more and try to catch a Razor III on-sale, which has better glass, charismatic turrets, and looks like it costs what it does. 

And whatever you do, stay away from the red trim version of the Burris XTR Pro.

"2025-04-18",1744985000,"Settled on a 5.56 setup after falling down the barrel length &amp; ammo rabbit hole","Lately Ive been trying to figure out what the ideal 5.56 setup looks like for home defense and general-purpose usesomething that could handle CQB distances but still be effective out to a couple hundred yards if needed. Im not military or LE, just a civilian who enjoys shooting and wanted to understand how barrel length and ammo choice actually affect terminal performance.

The first thing I ran into was velocity. 5.56 isnt a magic laser beamit relies heavily on fragmentation or expansion to do damage. Most FMJ loads need 2,500+ fps to yaw or fragment properly. Some expanding rounds (like bonded soft points or copper hollow points) can work below that threshold, but velocity still matters.

Barrel Length vs Velocity (Approximate):

Velocities are approximatereal-world numbers vary based on gas system, ammo brand, weather, etc.
Heres what I found in terms of velocity loss from different barrels using common 62gr loads:

	""	20  ~2,880 fps

	""	16  ~2,800 fps

	""	14.5  ~2,700 fps

	""	13.7  ~2,650 fps

	""	11.5  ~2,500 fps

	""	10.3  ~2,400 fps

That might not seem like much, but dropping below 2,500 fps can dramatically reduce fragmentation for FMJs. With rounds like M193, M855, and Mk262, you lose reliable fragmentation past about 100150 yards on shorter barrels. They just zip through without doing much internal damage.

Thats where ammo choice comes in. If youre running a short barrel, you need a round that doesnt rely entirely on fragmentation. Bonded soft points and solid copper hollow points fill that gap. They expand at lower velocities and still penetrate effectivelyeven through barriers.

Civilian/LE Ammo That Actually Performs:

	""	M193 (55gr FMJ): Cheap and fast from a 20 barrel, but it needs ~3,100+ fps to fragment reliably. Loses effectiveness quickly from shorter barrels.

	""	Federal TBBC (62gr)  This was developed for the FBI. Its a bonded soft point that expands reliably through glass, drywall, and even car doors. It penetrates 1418 in gel and expands to about 0.5 even at 2,500 fps.

	""	Speer Gold Dot (64gr)  Very similar to TBBC. Bonded jacket, consistent expansion, works great from short barrels.

	""	Barnes TSX (5570gr)  Copper solid. Doesnt fragment, but expands wide and stays together. Often used in jurisdictions that ban lead core ammo.

If youre military or restricted to FMJ, the best options seem to be:

	""	Mk318 Mod 0 (62gr)  Made for short barrels. Fragmenting front + solid base means it works well at lower velocity and punches through barriers.

	""	M855A1 (62gr EPR)  Yaws and fragments better than legacy M855. Works from 14.5 barrels and still gets decent effect past 300 yards.

	""	Mk262 Mod 1 (77gr OTM)  Great for soft targets at long range. Fragmentation is violent, but you need ~2,600+ fps to get the full effect, so best from 16+ barrels.

EDIT: What really sold me on TBBC over other options was its performance window. Unlike FMJ or OTM rounds that rely on fragmentation and need higher velocity to do real damage, TBBC is a bonded soft point that expands reliably down to about 2,200 fps. From a 14.5 barrel, it leaves the muzzle at around 2,700 fps, staying above that threshold out to roughly 250275 yards. That means you get consistent expansion across nearly all realistic engagement distances. By comparison, an 11.5 barrel launches it closer to 2,500 fps, and TBBC drops below its expansion floor somewhere around 100150 yards. So while shorter barrels are great for maneuverability, youre sacrificing terminal effectiveness the moment you stretch the range. The 14.5 setup preserves lethality while still keeping the rifle compact and fast-handling.

So why 14.5?

I originally assumed 10.311.5 would be ideal for maneuverability. But when you look at performance lossespecially velocity and effective range, its clear youre making big sacrifices:

	""	14.5 barrels still get ~2,700 fps with 62gr loads

	""	That gives bonded rounds full expansion capability past 250 yards

	""	Youre only losing ~2550 fps compared to a 16, but gaining a more compact rifle

	""	If you pin and weld a muzzle device and youre legally past the 16 minimum without registering as an SBR

Compare that to an 11.5youre looking at 200+ fps lost, which pushes bonded ammo close to its minimum velocity window and really limits range.

Accuracy

From multiple tests (including snipershide and LE sources), TBBC tends to shoot around 1.5 MOA from quality setups. Thats:

	""	~1.5 at 100 yards

	""	~4.5 at 300 yards

Easily enough to hit vital zones under pressure.

Optic Choice

I tried to figure out what would actually work across the 5300 yard range without being overkill.

	""	Vortex Razor Gen II-E 16x  Very forgiving eye box, daylight-bright reticle, and extremely fast at 1x. Weighs ~21.5 oz.

	""	Nightforce NX8 18x  Lighter and more compact, but tighter eye relief and not quite as good optically at 1x.

	""	Razor Gen III 110x  Tempting, but overkill unless youre consistently shooting past 400 yards. Heavier too.

Final Setup That Made the Most Sense:

	""	14.5 barrel with a pinned/welded muzzle device

	""	Federal TBBC or Speer Gold Dot

	""	Razor HD Gen II-E 16x optic

That setup keeps things compact, delivers full expansion and barrier performance, and still lets me reach out to 275300 yards with confidence.

It took a while to dig through all the ballistics data and testing sources, but I came out of it feeling way more confident about what worksand why.

;

TL;DR  Summary of What I Found:

	""	Dropping below 14.5 starts to hurt your velocity enough to limit range and terminal performance

	""	Bonded soft points (like Federal TBBC or Speer Gold Dot) expand reliably through barrierseven from short barrels

	""	M855A1 and Mk318 are the best FMJ-type rounds if youre stuck with Hague-compliant ammo

	""	14.5 barrels get ~2,700 fps with 62gr loadsmore than enough for reliable expansion out to 250+ yards

	""	TBBC is accurate to ~1.5 MOA, good enough for consistent torso hits to 300 yards

	""	Vortex Razor Gen II-E 16x is fast, bright, and ideal for a rifle used from 5300 yards

	""	These are the same rounds used by FBI, SOCOM, and a lot of LE agencies, so real-world data backs them up

	""	Went way deeper than I meant to, but maybe it saves someone else the research spiral","guns",169,"https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/1k25phi/settled_on_a_556_setup_after_falling_down_the/"

"2025-04-17",1744929136,"[Springfield Kuna] My first PCC","Hey guys,

I've carried a Springfield XDS for about 6 years (hard to remember), and I've been a fan of the brand as a result - even when they were getting lots of hate for supporting the Illinois Dealer Licensing act. Well, I guess I'm a fan of HS Produkt. My XDS has NEVER had a malfunction in 2-3k rounds of various FMJ and hollow point ammo, and it seems the general consensus is that Springfield's most reliable products aren't made by Springfield. I don't practice with my CCW as much as I should, but it has been through a decent amount of testing and shown incredible reliability. I also dig the grip safety, unlike 95% of the gun community. 
 
  
I've wanted a PCC since CZ dropped the Scorpion evo 3 in 2015. The idea of a compact home defense weapon that wouldn't immediately blow my eardrums if fired indoors was incredibly attractive. Cheap ammo means I get to practice more, and I love to shoot. I almost pulled the trigger the Scorpion a few times, but small things kept me away. ""Springfield just dropped a Stribog... why didnt you just get the Stribog?"" I thought it was ugly. Yep. That's the whole reason. 
  
When I saw that Springfield was dropping a fully ambi (Iefty) roller-delayed PCC for under a grand, i knew I was going to buy one. I know the roller delay system isnt mp5 level, but simply not being direct blowback at this price point is impressive. Not much competition here. I'm usually a late adopter of products, but it checked too many boxes for me, and I have a lot of trust in HS Produkt. We will see if that trust was misplaced with time.  
  
I called my LGS today for shits and giggles, thinking there was no chance they would have one. I had 6 different online shops on ""notify me"", and figured one call couldn't hurt. Turns out they got this Kuna in last night. After I bought it, I heard a sales guy in the store say ""did someone buy the Kuna already??"" Think he was bummed and wanted to play with it some more. I had developed a relationship with the guys there when I was shooting 3 days a week at their range, so they took care of me on the price. Not going to give full details, but let's just say I'm very happy, considering what many people are willing to pay right now. 
  
I'm looking forward to shooting the Kuna and working on my PCC shooting abilities. I'd like to get my wife up to speed with the platform ASAP. It always bothered me that she would be trying to defend herself with a pistol if someone broke into our home. Pistols are simply difficult to operate accurately for inexperienced shooters. I want her to be able to get shots on target. Welp, that's enough rambling for me. Just riding the high of new gun day. Take care, guys.

I am torn between purchasing a Marlin 1894 Classic or a Miroku Winchester 1892 Carbine, both in .357 Magnum.

I am leaning towards the Winchester because of how simplistic and beautiful it is as well as I've read many posts online talking about how the Japanese made quality by Miroku is wonderful and better than Marlin.

But I'm worried about the feeding. I'd primarily be using .38 Special since it is cheaper.

I've shot sub-MOA groups with 150 and 180 grain ammo from Federal and Remington on maybe four different occasions since I got the rifle. 

I come out to the ranch to shoot it longer range for fun and to see if I could get an ethical hunting accuracy further out but I go to verify my zero and realize my scope's magnification control ring is jammed into the scope mount, so I adjust the rings and go to rezero but before I get it dialed in I realize it's jammed again and when I go to adjust again a screwhead strips so my rings are toast. Go into town to get more ammo at this point and new rings, come back and get all set up checking action screws and mount screws and the screws on the rings themselves and go to shoot and I can get it where I want it at 25 but then I shoot at 100 and can't hit crap. Ten inch target, first shot'll drill the center, second's off the paper, no idea which way. I went from the 25 to the 100 and back probably four times and have no idea what is going on. 

What else can I eliminate? I can't up and replace the scope right now but while I'm out here away from home what else can I factor out? There was a 15ish mph tailwind basically right behind me, can't imagine it's that. I mean this rifle has shot sub-MOA several times with several different ammo types and all of a sudden I can't stay on the paper. 

EDIT

Issue solved

I realized that A) my ""clear shooting lane"" was slightly less clear than I thought as evidenced by thrashed and frayed grass about 25 yards forward of the target and B) I had been inconsistent in my stance, sometimes resting the rifle on the front sling stud, which I found to affect my POI by about seven inches. 

Before A and B I also removed and methodically re-tightened my rings, though I am about 25 miles from civilization and don't have a way to accurately measure torque. I suppose it could have contributed, but eliminating the grass stopped the horizontal variety and noticing the sling stud issue eliminated the vertical.

In the process of purchasing my first Stainless Steel firearm: a Ruger GP100 6"". Stoked!

I'm just curious what is different in terms of care for stainless steel vs a blued finish, or a nitride finish. 

I know Stainless is more resilient, but do I still need to keep the firearm oiled? Any cleaners that I shouldn't be using on Stainless? I often times use brake cleaner on stubborn buildup on ARs, and wasn't sure if that was OK for a stainless finish or if it could somehow etch/""stain"" it.

My blued firearms always wear and develop unique blemishes that I honestly like. Does Stainless wear at all? 

Last question: obviously with blued firearms, a blemish would need sanded down and reblued. On stainless, can I simply sand down and let be? Is it possible to sand/polish away damage?

I have the choice between 40% off of a new Franchi Affinity 3 or a used SX3.

I don't have the luxury of being able to find places to test these shotguns near me, and the person who I've learned the most from INSISTS that the Winchester shotguns are the way to go, but if I have 40% off of a brand new Affinity 3 I just want to make sure I hear it from someone else on their opinions and reviews.

I believe in ""buy once, cry once"" so I was leaning towards the SX3, but I want to use it for more than clays/one demensional. I'm not afraid of recoil but I don't want something that feels like my 870 every trigger pull.

As the title suggests, I want your advice on how to do it. I've been shooting for like an year recently but not with civilian firearms but with sports firearms (ISSF standard rifles) like Walther KK500 and Grunig+Elmiger Racer R3 (burned through almost 5000 rounds in the last 6 months). The trigger is super light (The KK500 I used was around 120g total pull) and a few days ago I tried a Smith and Wesson Mod 63... Let's say it didnt' go well cause as soon as the hammer started to pull back my hands started shaking and the aim was terrible. I was surprised with how hard the trigger pull was and even after practicing like 100ish rounds I am still not confident. It got even worse when I tried an old Webley Scott .32 revolver... I couldn't even fire it without giving a jerk to trigger which resulted in fliers.

Also, I want to know the proper way to grip a firearm cause I did some research and people have their own way of holding it rather than a sure shot way to practice it and get confidence. Some suggest the dominant hand to be light squeeze and the other to be super hard squeeze while the others suggest the opposite and some suggest to hold it firmly with both hands.

P.S. I want to learn to shoot revolvers specifically cause I am eyeing on a Manurhin MR88 (I tried looking for MR73 but it isn't available though I am gonna keep looking for it just in case)

I apologize in advance is this was covered in another thread, I could not find one pertaining to what I wanted to ask.

Forgive my ignorance on the subject, I have little experience with Glock-related stuff. I have a Shadow Systems XR920P and a few Magpul P-mags for it in various capacities. While the Magpul ones works work well enough (I did have some feeding issues, though I chalk that up to dirty, cheap ammo) I picked up a Glock OEM mag the other day and like the overall fit and finish more. As this is one of my ""break glass in case of emergency"" firearms I want to prioritize relatability; however, I would like a few mags in a large capacity than the flush-fit 17 round option.

I've checked the OEM options and don't see much other than the massive 33-round stick (again, not much of a Glock person so if I missed an obvious alternative option let me know) and wanted to ask for input from folks that have more experience with both Glock(ish) mags and extended baseplates.

I have extended baseplates for other pistols, which all work quite well, but those are pretty different due to material and dimensions. I wanted to inquire if Glock mags work well with extended baseplates or if that combo is known for being finicky and temperamental. I've run into that behavior with mags for other platforms and would like to avoid that headache. I also wanted to see if folks have experienced better reliability and performance with stock mags overall.

Any insight or suggestions would be appreciated, would be nice to have a half dozen or so extra mags of around 21+ capacity for having fun at the range but keeping in the old ""oh shit!"" bag. Also please feel free to suggest other brands you've had good experience with.

Model 1914 First Variant Type 4

The observed Melior Model 1914 first variation type 4 pistols with serial numbers 38182, 38407, 38434, 38517, and 38797 have a type 2 safety lever.

These Melior pistols have a three-line inscription on the slide with the slogan ""Tout en Acier"" and were sold on the French market.

This is the last observed pistol of the first variation that has an angular frame shape at the rear. The frame shape change occurred in the range between serial numbers 38797 and 39015.","guns",1,"https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/1k3rc8f/melior_brevets_pistol/"

I have a question about a recent issue I had with a shotgun this past week. I have a Stevenson 320 12 gauge pump shotgun, which I won at a NWTF raffle. This was the first time I shot it. 

I loaded it with 3 inch Winchester XX turkey loads and shot it. The shot erupted and I felt like I had been hit with a sledgehammer (I shoot regularly and this recoil was easily three times the kick I have ever felt with a 12 gauge turkey load). The force from the shot blew the bolt back and the extractor jammed - as the brass was torn up. 

I have never had this happen with any turkey gun before. To be sure that it wasnt an ammo issue, my brother shot two shells from the same box in his Remington and it shot fine. 

It was such a violent and over-pressured explosion that Im worried to shoot turkey loads through it again after what happened. The last thing I want to do is have it blow up in my face. 

Im wondering if anyone has had any similar issues with this brand of shotgun and has any advice on what to do and if it can be fixed. ","guns",19,"https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/1k3qdgw/stevens_320_turkey_load_malfunction/"

I installed a Holosun EPS on my GLOCK 19.5. I attempted to zero it at 15 yards with a shitty bench rest. It was a bit difficult, so i reduced the zeroing to 10 yards. I got a 2-3inch group at 10 yards. Felt pretty janky using the bench rest and my inexperience with red dots led me to just leave it as is.

My groups at 5 yards are 0.5- 1 inches. My groups at 7 yards is 1-2 inches.

I have some experience with red dots from shooting CCOs on the m4 rifle (I'm military) so I have a small idea of how to focus with red dots.

My questions are:

1. Should i go for a more precise zero again or just practice with the red dot more before i try to zero more?
2. The bench rest was a bit janky. feel like zeroing while completely holding the pistol without a sandbag or benchrest might be more conducive.

Update: To clarify, my point is that there are certain scenarios where double ear protection will not fully protect you from minute hearing damage caused by firearms. Particularly with muzzle brakes on high calibers. Sure the damage is minuscule, but over a very long time period it can noticeably damage your hearing. Im not arguing against hearing protection.

The gun only seems to like CCI standard velocity ammo, and after a while it bends the feed lips of whatever mag I put into it so all the rounds stovepipe when they're being fed from it, leading to constant jams until I bend the lips back. It did the same with another aftermarket mag replacement.

I like the gun and the story of how I got it shocks people (you got it for how much!?), but I think it might be time to trade the old girl in for something that likes all types of 22lr and will be a bit more reliable. I'm not quite sure what to get.

I watched a video of a man on a range with a scope that showed where to aim to hit the target no matter the lean or canted tilt, the chevron moved and he lined it up, shot and ping it hit the target. the scope also had alot of other information like direction wind etc. 

But my question is. 

Could you or is there already a scope that does the reverse? 

Effectively what ever you aim the centre reticle at theres little motors on the scope that move the scope so that it minutely forces you to move your aim to line it up then when it is properly lined up it changes color and then you shoot. 

Does that exist or could it be made?

Hello, I made the mistake of not contacting this FFL before placing an order for two separate firearms to deliver to them. My bad, historically the other ones Ive dealt with have just called me when the order comes in and seemed happy to have the business and completed the transfer no problem.

When the guns arrived I called and emailed them and received an email back the same day. They pointed out I should have contacted them first, asked for my information and explained their days of business and asked if there was time on those days I would like to come by. I responded with the information they asked for and a time I could come by. My response was sent 4/4/25. I have since emailed 2 more times and had PSA (the seller) reach out and leave a message and we have gotten no response.

Wondering what I should do? I accept responsibility for my part in creating this situation, again my experience in the past had been these people listed themselves on distributors websites because they wanted to do these transfers, and that I was bringing them welcome business, maybe thats not always the case. PSA has offered to request that the FFL send the guns back but the guys website says theres a $150/gun fee for rejects or returns. The impression I get is hes hoping Ill try to go that route cause he makes even more money that way and screws me over. His standard transfer fee is $75 + $10 for each additional gun.

Initially in my search for suppressors I was fairly sure I would go with a Dead Air can, specifically one from the Sandman line, so I went ahead and bought a keymo ready muzzle brake. After weighing the options and budgeting I decided to go with a cheaper can without the keymo QD system. My question to y'all is: is it worth it to spend the extra $200-250 on a hub adapter or should I just eat the cost of the $70 muzzle brake? Is there significant performance I would be leaving on the table if I don't get the adapter? I plan to use this can consistently and its my only rifle so I wouldn't be swapping it to another firearm regularly, if ever. Thank you.

The only experience I have is with larger revolvers (.357, 460 magnum) and I know for sure it is a terrible idea with them. But recently I had an itch to start browsing smaller revolvers (j-frame) so I went to my local mom and pop just to get an idea of just how small they are compared to the bigger stuff.

Point being made here, I went to the shop and started experimenting with grips because j-frames are much smaller than I realize. Go figure I started with cross thumb and the guy behind the counter starting berating me about it being the worst possible grip and if I don't break such a terrible habit I probably shouldn't consider buying one. Just curious, does crossed thumb grip have a bad rap? Does it actually make that big of a difference for smaller carry revolvers like the 642? No experience with them, so I'm assuming based on his reaction people really don't like it?

Just curious because the normal thumb over thumb grip I use on my revolvers felt real awkward on all the small revolvers I approached. Crossed definitely wasn't what I'm used to, but it felt a little bit less awkward in the hand.","guns",30,"https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/1k5fj8a/crossed_thumb_revolver_grip/"

I've got a small lock for the zippers and am planning to use a cable lock to secure the bag by the handles to the back seat in trunk under the privacy cover so it won't be visible. But I know realistically if someone broke in a knife through the handles and it would be gone. 

Both my job and my appointment are in good areas so the chances are of it getting broken into are low and I have been looking into getting a vehicle safe of some sort but haven't found one that I like/fits my vehicle. Taking my bag into either office is also a no go.

"2025-04-27",1745779200,"A Question Regarding Surefire X300","Hello folks,

I have a question for folks who carry/use the Surefire X300 Weapon Mounted Light (WML). I recently picked one up, having never really used one before, and encountered a slight complication I hadn't accounted for. Chiefly, I struggle with actuating the the switch, my hands are perhaps a bit on the smaller side (I believe I wear a medium glove) and the pistol I have it mounted to has an oversized trigger guard. So the switch is further forward than I can reach easily.

While I can activate the light with my support hand's thumb I can't easily switch it back into the ""Off"" position without breaking my grip. Largely I believe the issue is a combination of my hand size and how far forward the light sits. I could of course place it on another pistol that mounts it closer but that's not the purpose of this post.

For anyone that has encountered a similar issue, how did you address or work around this? Will the switch on the X300 loosen up with use and become easier to actuate or will I need to practice a technique to workaround this particular challenge?

I appreciate any input and feedback anyone can provide, or even just your own anecdotal accounts of working with this WPL.

Thanks in advance.","guns",2,"https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/1k9b41n/a_question_regarding_surefire_x300/"

"2025-04-27",1745728077,"House got broken into. Many firearms stolen. Learn from my mistakes.","I came home on Thursday to my house broken into.  Fucker got most of my firearms, though they missed a few.  Long story short, learn from me:

1.  Never leave your safe unlocked.  I got complacent and that's how so many were stolen.  I was working on several firearms, rearranging the safe, and stupidly left it open.  I've had this safe for 10+ years, but it just takes one day for someone to break in.
2.  Write down every firearm make, model, and serial number you own and keep that information in a safe place that is easily accessed.  Include details like finish, barrel length, modifications, scope brand and model, and caliber/gauge.  I live in CA and the sheriff was able to pull my sales records, but several rifles and shotguns weren't in the records because CA somewhat recently started keeping track of serial numbers for rifles/shotguns.  Politics aside, it was actually a blessing that they were able to track most of what was stolen.  Trying to track down serial numbers is a *bitch*, especially if they were purchases long ago like many of mine were.  Gunbroker transactions only go back 90 days (WTF?).  Many warhorses I bought were like 15+ years ago and looking for the website I bought them from was fruitless; even if you ask the FFL where you transferred them from, how many years of records do they keep?  How could they easily search for them?
3.  Invest in security cameras NOW.  I got Blink wireless cameras that detect motion and send me a text alert when they notice something.  
4.  Talk to your neighbors and establish relationships.  I live in a rural area and my only close neighbor literally saw a strange pickup truck on my property but figured I hired a contractor to do something.  If he would have contacted me, I could have immediately called the cops and told them something was afoot.  What a lost opportunity.
5.  I also lost pellet guns that obviously don't go through an FFL.  Unfortunately the one that was stolen was a very high end rifle and unless a miracle happens, I'll never see it again.  Serial number is key, and I don't have it.
6.  While you're writing down serial numbers for firearms, write down serial numbers for anything valuable.  The thief didn't notice my digital camera, my iPad, my laptop, and all my top tier hifi audio gear.  I was lucky for those things not being stolen, but unless you have a serial number, good luck ever proving ownership.

There is nothing more gutting than coming home and realizing your house has been broken into.  PLEASE take my advice to prevent this from happening to you, or at worst, you'll have evidence to provide to police.  I have several non-firearms related things stolen that I never expect to see again (mountain bike, pressure washer, guitars, gas cans, etc) but police do *not* like stolen firearms and they will work that case.  Give them all the information you possibly can and hopefully you prevent a theft but if it happens, you can give them as much information as possible.

UPDATE: A NEIGHBOR HAS A CAMERA SYSTEM THAT GOT FOOTAGE OF THE TRUCK COMING AND GOING.  No license plate but he got video of both sides of the truck including body damage, paint damage and custom rims. 
 He's saying you'd easily be able to identify this truck out in the wild if you saw it.  I'm waiting for the neighbor to figure out how to download the video and provide it to me, it's killing me inside not having it.  I really want to see if the driver is at all recognizable.

UPDATE 2: The cameras didn't get a license plate number and the driver is too blurry to identify, but it's not a truck I recognize.  This is not looking like it was done by someone I know.

I also purchased a decent red dot sight because Im impulsive.

Im going to the range in a few days and I wanted to ask:

Should I strap the red dot on that bad boy and give it a shot to zero it in? Or should I stay without and focus on shooting it first?

Im afraid I dont have the fundamentals to zero in without my variance being human error, but I also dont know what to expect or what I should even focus on for my first time with a handgun at the range.

1st place: Smith and Wesson 10-5, my all time favorite gun and probably most valued. Was my grandpas that he gave me was my first daily shooter and Ive never had a single problem with it, beautiful gun.
2nd place: 91/30 mosin nagant, this was my first rifle I bought when I was 21 got it for 350$ and I love this rifle shoots great (a little to the right) but for my first rifle she has never failed me (except once when my buddy and I send 200 rounds down it at once and the bolt locked up on us near the 140 mark
3rd place: Mk4 Lee Enfield, honestly I got the Lee enfield as a scoped rifle but after a while I felt like I preferred it with iron sights so I removed the scope mount, unfortunately I lost the screw that holds the irons in so I replaced it with and Allen wrench (please dont kill me) but I love to preform my mad minute with this gun and is always a blast to shoot, also reliable as hell with the exception of rim lock 
4th place: Ruger Blackhawk, this is another gift gun but from my uncle who moved to Italy, well technically not mine since Im sure he wont mind me using it (dont worry uncle I take care of it like my own) Its honestly a really fun gun to shoot but the price of .357 is not fun, also I remember when I was a kid shooting this gun and not liking it but now that Im older and grown wayyy out of .22 I like the kick it has
5th place: post war P-38/P1, this was my first semi auto pistol before her it was all revolvers but it wasnt all fun and games with her, I really had to learn how to take care of this one as it is a low serial number one and before this I had never cleaned a semi but she has proved herself a trusty pistol and this is what I carry on me when I go out
6th place: 1911, I wanted a 1911, thats all
7th place: Smith and Wesson .22 mag, this is the gun I grew up with it was my grandpas then my dads and now mine, Im not going to lie this pistol is finicky you cant shoot anything but Winchester anything else is and after a few shots will lock up the cylinder, also now that I have large hands the tiny pistol is less than desirable but I still take her out every so often

The 870 has a Mesa High Tube Adapter, a B&amp;T Pump tri rail with an M249 grip on it, HK416 Iron Sights, and an Aridus Side Saddle. I'm think about having a custom full length top rail made for this gun so that I can have any semblance of a Sight Radius, but this is where we are now.

I am currently saving up to send the entire Mossberg to Vang Comp and have them do there tactical upgrade service to it. Having real iron sights on this gun would be real great. I'd also like to see if I can find a Mossberh 590A1 Bayonet Lug for them to silver solder to the barrel. A full length breacher barrel with a bayonet sounds so ridiculous that I want to do it of I can. It in a way reminds me of that weird trend in the early to mid 2010's where everything was zombie apocalypse, and over the top. Maybe Mossberg sells the bayonet lug as a standoff alone part to gunsmiths, I don't know. I may have to reach out to my dude, or Vang Comp (when I'm ready to do the upgrade, which may take a while depending on what else I have going on in life).

Being my first longer range rifle I'm not super knowledgeable on the topic, but I've done a ton of research the last week or so and think this scope may be my best bet. Its really going to mainly be used as a range gun. But id like it to be light enough to hunt with if i ever decided to. We don't have really long ranges out here, I think the furthest is 400-500 yards so the top end of 22x should be plenty. I was originally looking at sub 1000 scopes but saw this for what i thinks a good price and am willing to stretch to this price but I can't go higher. As is this scope cost as much as my rifle lol. 

For 1200+ tax it checks all the boxes:

ffp, wide magnification range with a decent top end power, good glass (from reviews atleast), illuminated reticle, i like the reticle it self, rock solid warranty with vortex is a HUGE plus.

Is it worth it, or should I drop back to the viper pst gen 2ish price bracket? Ive read some people say it has issues with holding zero,  but after looking into it it seems every sub 3k does lol","guns",7,"https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/1k7yiuh/vortex_razor_hd_lht_4522x50/"

I have shot my Dad's guns quite often before, a gen 3 Glock 17 and a smith &amp; wesson .357 magnum.

I have shot a K98 and an AR15 once.

I defenetaly want to get a pistol rather than a rifle, but I dont really have that much knowledge. The only restriction I have (legal reasons in my country) is only semi auto, so something like a Glock 18 would be off limits. I dont care about girly color options, so that is nothing to be concerned about. (location: germany)

Guns I like are CZ and 1911, but as that pretty much sums up my gun knowledge, I'm not sure if one of those is good for a beginner.

I'd like to stay with 9mm  rounds, but its not a must.

Budget is not really a problem. I'd say maximum would be around 2000 bucks, gun only without any extra like laser, sight, ammo etc.

Im very thankful for any advice.

EDIT:  
after some imput from you guys and a lot of reconsideration on my end, i think I will go for the CZ shadow 2. seems to be a really good gun performacne wise, it looks cool as hell, shoots easy to get and cheap 9mm rounds, and is easy to care for.

Use will mostly be close range wild boar and maybe some deer. It wont be the primary firearm on a trip, I have a 4-12x .308 setup for that. Just something for a bit of fun thats got plenty of kick. 

Priority is quick target acquisition but with the versatility of some low powered zoom, will also be using in dawn and dusk situations so low light performance is a factor. 

Naturally I was leaning towards a hybrid setup: an eotech reflex with their g45 magnifier however when taking some measurements I dont think I could comfortably get close enough for the max eye relief of 2.6inch although its definitely doable just doesnt seem optimal. Others have run optics like the Aimpoint Micro H-1 on bolt action rifles in this scenario, Id just like to get some magnification benefits but seem to be striking out when it comes to eye relief.

"2025-04-30",1746021493,"Greencard Holder Denied after passing 3 check in the past","Hey y'all, I've been a greencard holder since 2024 and own two handguns and a pistol. Never had issues with 4473 other than being delayed for two days on all of them before getting a proceed. Ordered myself a new Beretta 92x on gunbroker and came to my local FFL to transfer, filled out the form and it didn't submit initially because they said dashes in my USCIS# won't let it sumbit and we had to remove them. The next morning got a call that I got denied, got the transaction number and submitted a form to get the reasons and apparently FBI thinks I'm an illegal alien. 

Now I'm disputing the denial( literally just uploaded pic of my greencard and said ""yo wtf, I'm legal and never had issues"" ), I know I just have to wait but I'm pissed and it's ruining my mood because everything usually goes smooth. I also don't want to go through all the work to submit a VAF and get a UPIN because I shouldn't be denied in the first place. But if it has to be done , might as well get a CCW too to not worry about it in future. Love the fact that I have to pay all the fees for something that is not my problem.

The other issue is , FFL told me they can't hold a firearm since it's not theirs but the original FFL in a different state from who I ordered it and they have to ship it back. As I understand if I get decision overturned within 30 days then I can get it with original 4473. If I have to do a check again then there's a high chance will happen again.

Anyone been in a similar situation? 

UPDATE:
Just received an email. Verdict - decision overturned, I am eligible. Got the certificate and will go to the FFL to continue the process.

2. An 11.5"" ar running 55gr is only really effective to 50m. 77gr extends this a bit but with (major or minor?) compromises to lethality within 50m.

"2025-04-29",1745951416,"Wife finally fought her own gun","EDIT: She BOUGHT her first gun, sorry for the accidental click bait lol 

After about 4 years of being together, my wife surprised me one morning recently by saying I want to buy a gun and get my CCW.

She started out being pretty anti gun as a result of anti-gun propaganda and being raised in a household that didnt talk about guns. 

After a two years of being together, I bought my first gun and started the CCW process due to increased crime in our area. I only bought the gun after discussing it at length with her and making sure she was comfortable with having one in our apartment. After a few months of conversations she finally agreed to a tan pistol because the black ones were scary lol. 

A little while later, we got a tan shotgun because the black ones were still scary to her but turns out, she really liked shooting the shotgun. The pistol is a bit much for her to handle because of the recoil but she loves the shotgun. Fast forward two years and we have seen more crime, found ourselves in several situations where a CCW would have been nice to have (local CCW permit takes about two years), and overall just got her more comfortable with the idea of guns. About a month ago I got my CCW and have been carrying every day since. We also got married and have started talking about kids in these last two years.

I floated the idea of her eventually getting her own ccw since she will at some point be alone with our future kids and that it would be smart for her to have an option of self defense. Since the process takes two years, she could get the gun now and take time to get used to it, learn how to shoot it, and once she gets it she doesnt have to carry every single day but she would at least have the option to. She sat on that for a few weeks and the other day told me she decided she wanted to get her own gun. We put a deposit down on an all black (she longer thinks the black guns are scary lol) G19 for off body carry (cross body bag/fanny pack kinda thing) this last weekend.

Overall Im super happy that she came to this decision on her own, I of course have helped her along but it was important to me that I never forced the gun issue on her. I wanted her to own the decision to get a gun and now she is planning on carrying while raising our future kids. 

Lessons learned for other guys (or girls) in the same situation:
- find a gun store that will treat your wife with respect, the first store we went into the guy opened the conversation with how about a pink gun for the little lady and we immediately walked out. She didnt want to step foot in a gun store again for a while. We eventually found a store with a really nice female attendant who knows more about guns than any other attendant weve met, and she takes the time to explain things to my wife and I rather than just treating us like idiots. She made a huge difference in making my wife comfortable with guns
- maybe dont start with a gun that has a lot of recoil. My M&amp;P shield was very snappy and takes a lot of effort to control the recoil, this initially scared her away from pistols. My wife loves shooting our maverick 88 and Ruger PCC. 
- be patient, dont force anything. If you want long term success, your wife has to be part of the decision making process. Dont force her to do things she isnt comfortable with at the range either. At first, she would frequently step outside of the range because the noise/shockwaves of nearby larger guns would make her uncomfortable. We have found that we both enjoy outdoor ranges more for this reason 
- be willing to make compromises. I bought a tan M&amp;P shield instead of the black one because she didnt like the black ones. Does the color make a difference? To her it did, it made it more comfortable for her for some reason. So thats what we went with. Now look at her, she is going to be the proud owner of an all black Glock 19 lol
- make shooting a fun sport, not just about self defense. Initially, she didnt want to think about having to use a gun in self defense. However, she liked the competitive aspect of shooting trap with the shotgun and target shooting with the Ruger PCC. When she would come to the range with me, we wouldnt use body silhouette targets, instead we would use playing card targets or others that our range has available. 

Overall, listen to your wife and be patient lol. Im super proud of her for taking such a big step towards helping protect our family and exercising her second amendment right ","guns",58,"https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/1kav8ei/wife_finally_fought_her_own_gun/"

Notarized my application. They also sold me tax stamps that would be needed to pay for the actual license at the police station.  They also set up my appointment for the next day at Police station in San Juan. They put my packadge together and explained exactly what to do.  Only thing was. They told me I might need a PR resident address.  They said it depended on the agent I spoke to.  I have family in PR so I asked my cousin to  email me a copy of light bill and scan of license.  Which I ended up needing

Dec 12:  went to to police station 8am appointment.
Turned in package.  Agent went over it with a check list.  Told me I needed to be fingerprinted and get a PR criminal background check.  But not to worry just go to first floor and I get both there.  Went down got printed and after buying a $2.50 tax stamp at a vending machine i proceeded to the window for criminal check gave them stamp with my filled out form.  Sat for about 2 minutes.  Was called and given my certificate of ""Good Boy""  went back upstairs finished the application process Agent scanned everything into system returned package with a number written on it and told me  30 to 45 days.  And I had to personally pick it up. Now the wait turned out to be longer because 45 days did not count weekends Christmas eve, Christmas day,  day after christmas, New Years eve,  New Years day.  3 Kings day.....lol.   I couldnt return till April 17th.  But went in and asked about it.  Agent asked  for ID,  and went into the back and came out with my new PR  Licensia de Armas good for 5 years. Which I signed for receiving it. 

It is costly,   160 for class, 200 for initial application, $2.50 for PR background check. but it was really not too bad.  If you go at it alone it could be a little confusing but I wholly recommend CODEPOLA.  They made the process very easy did all the heavy work with the application.  With the $120 I got that service.  They also have lawyers on call that deal with gun laws in PR in case of anything.  They have shooting events and gun stores across the island.  

Hope this update helps anyone intetested","guns",17,"https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/1kaqz0f/just_got_my_non_resident_puerto_rico_firearm/"

Found a cheap Gen 3 Glock 23 (.40 cal) and started thinking& for not much money, I could either just swap in a 9mm barrel and mags and basically have a Glock 19, or grab a full 9mm slide from PSA or AimSurplus and throw OEM Glock internals in it. Same deal with a Glock 27  swap it to a 26 setup. Could even build it into a full custom over time if I want.

At the same time& kinda feels dumb when you can just go buy a Canik, M&amp;P, or Springfield thats already pretty much perfect right out of the box.

Stuff Im thinking about:

Pros:
	""	Gen 3 Glocks are stupid simple to work on.
	""	Aftermarket parts are cheap and easy to find.
	""	.40 frames are overbuilt  perfect for 9mm conversions.
	""	Id get another caliber (full .40 setup), plus still have the option to easily convert to 9mm or .357 SIG whenever I want.
	""	Could either keep it cheap with just a barrel swap, or throw on a complete new slide and really build it out.
	""	Would be a fun project gun, and I could piece it together over time instead of dropping a bunch of money at once.
	""	Also  people saying .40 is dead dont really know what theyre talking about. The same modern ammo tech that made 9mm better also made .40 better. Shot placement still wins fights, but .40 will always hit harder than 9mm, plain and simple.

Cons:
	""	Costs do add up  barrel, slide, internals, sights, etc.

I've been thinking about picking up a .22lr pistol for a myriad of reasons, the chief among them being a fun/easy pistol for my wife to shoot. She is not terribly experienced with them, but enjoys shooting. I have a fair amount of experience around guns, but I'm nowhere near an expert when it comes to picking them.

I own a Glock 19, and I'm considering buying a Ruger P95 (2012 if it matters) from a buddy. I'm very tempted to pick up a conversion kit for my 19, or if such a thing exists for the Ruger, I may be open to that instead. If I'm allowed to tack on a side question, is the P95 any good? I know nothing about it, and trying to find information of any kind about the exact model has been a challenge for me.

From the posts I did find here, it seems that Glock conversion kits are a bit touchy about ammo. If that was true, is it still? And generally speaking, are conversion kits a good option, or is it best to pick up a separate gun?

Again, I hope this post is allowed. Thanks in advance.

3) Prodigy: decent.

Hi everyone! My wife was recently complaining about the included stock on her Savage MKII 22LR, so I had a look around to see what was available. The market offerings in Canada were either $1,000+ for some kind of MDT chassis or $300 'budget' chassis... I came across the neglected Apache Chassis by u/Bigbore_729 and figured I could give it some love and add a few fixes and features.

Bigbore kindly pointed me toward his latest iteration of Savage Chassis, the MCS, however it was a bit more than I was looking for (utilizing AR style hand guards in addition to buffer tubes and stocks). So I fired up Fusion 360 and started reversing the MCS design back down to the Apache roots.

I have a few buddies with ATRS Enhanced Magazine Releases on their MKIIs, so I refined the geometry of the body to perfectly accept the EMR perfectly while still looking nice without one.

And obviously I wanted to add more than just some stylized lightening cuts to the original design, so I figured I would implement Magpul's MLOK system into the fore end... Which resulted in my implemented three different lengths because my friends all had differing opinions on the best length.

If you're interested, the design is available freely on Maker World here:

As you can see in the title I'm torn between 3 options for my CC. The options and what I think of them are listed below. 

Requirements:

- At least 13 (12+1) rnd 9mm capacity 
- optics cut/system that allows enclosed optics with a 1 plate maximum (for example needing an adapter plate AND an ACRO/509t plate is not ok)
- At most 1.4in width/at most 5.3 in height
- customizability/aftermarket is preferred but not necessary 
- also any thoughts/comments/recommendations for concealed carry, optics choice, holster choice, guns, etc. are welcome
- I am working on a budget of about ~$1200 which includes optics and whatever else I might need. 
- I also need suggestions for carrying with pants without belt loops (I almost exclusively wear sweats)


OPTION 1:

P365 fuse

- wilson combat frame
- meprolight mpo pro s
- extra 17rnd magazine
- holster/belt combo

~$1200

OPTION 2:

Smith and Wesson M&amp;P CC (polymer)

- dogtag optics plate
- EPS carry
- extra 15 rnd mag
-holster/belt combo

~$1100

OPTION 3:

Walther PDP pro E-4 (4in compact)

- Walther provides an optics plate
- EPS regular

I inadvertently discovered a strange quirk with my new Bobcat. I'm used to shooting striker fired handguns without safeties, so sometimes I forget that I have to disengage a safety when firing single action pistols like this.

Anyways, if the trigger is pulled with the safety engaged, and then safety subsequently disengaged, said disengaging of safety will drop the hammer.

I noticed that pulling the trigger with the safety engaged actually drops the hammer, but the hammer is, I assume, being caught by the safety. I'm assuming there's a third sear notch on the hammer and a corresponding sear on the safety. I'm assuming though that's redundant, and secondary to the trigger block safety. I can't imagine what the trigger block safety is even there for if we're essentially relying on the safety to catch the hammer as a primary mechanism. I can't see inside of it, I can only see the trigger block safety with the grip removed, so not quite sure what's going on in there.

It doesn't appear that the hammer is striking the firing pin, and I haven't tried this with live ammunition to test yet. I believe that the hammer is being caught by the half cock notch.

The trigger block safety does appear to be working for double action. I.e. if the hammer is at half cock with the safety on, the trigger can't be pulled far enough to drop the hammer. I'm not sure why it works in double action mode and not single action.","guns",13,"https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/1kc0l9t/21a_bobcat_dropping_hammer_when_safety_is/"

"2025-05-06",1746491346,"Recent past gun lore/gospel that is now anything but gospel?","I was thinking back to when I purchased my first handgun (eg. I was old enough and had the coin to go to a store and buy it for myself). This was in something like 2001-2002. Back then DA/SA semiautomatics were far more prevalent than nowadays. I remember picking out some shitty Taurus (hey, I earned minimum wage working at the library of my university at the time). It was 9mm. I will never forget this smug, older (guessing in his 40's), dickhead that was standing nearby and said something like ""9mm? Psssh, you're just gonna make someone mad with dat! 40 is a real caliber!"". Strangely, he didn't volunteer to test his claim, which he said with maximum smug authority.

Back then, there were plenty of people that thought the way that gun store primate thought. It brings a smile to my face every time that memory pops into my head. I wonder what Mr. Fotay is up to these days. Did he capitulate and sheepishly trade his 40s in for 9mm? Does he vociferously defend the 40 on the internets in the face of its clear decline in popularity? Does he ignorantly continue to spend too much money on his ammo and struggle with follow up shots? Does he not have time to shoot because he spends his days worrying about when he needs to change his colostomy bag? Ok, the last is below the belt, but 2001 was a long time ago now, he's getting up there in years. 

Being involved with guns and discussions of them on the internet for over a quarter century, a lot of fads have come and gone, a lot of gun gospel has changed and even done full 180 degree course changes. LE departments seem to be dropping the 40 at increasing pace and its popularity amongst non-LE has never been lower in my gun ownership lifetime. Things done changed since that day I bought that Taurus (I sold it 5 years later, sort of wish I had kept it as a memento, it will always have a special place in my heart). Keep in mind that Federal Hydrashoks were already prevalent at the time, it had zero to do with ""advances in 9mm ammo"" in 2001.

What other ""common knowledge"" or consensus ideas of the recent past are now dead?

I feel like lasers were still considered the hotness back then. Night sights too, if you didn't have tritium you were definitely gonna die in a gun fight after dusk. Those ClipDraw ""holsters"" for Glocks seemed to be considered perfectly acceptable to a majority of people then. The Massad Ayoob idea that if you changed anything about your carry gun you would end up in a Fed Pen for life was certainly prevalent (same with any gun incident involving a Title II item... that's NFA for you newbs). Everyone was counting down days until they could mount a bayonet on their AR15 (I admit, I was one also).... totally useless. Anything other than metal USGI mags were looked at with enormous skepticism (AR15). Hell, even a decent number of people were still apprehensive/skeptical of those plastic ""gangster"" guns that are recognized as possibly the most reliable factory pistols known as Glocks.

"2025-05-06",1746491116,"Who has the record for the longest OpticsPlanet backorder that eventually arrived?","And is it me? 

TL:DR I just had the final item from my order arrive today, almost 21 months to the day after the rest of it.  

I had been chatting with my father, and he mentioned to me that due to some issues in his neighborhood, he wanted to take his old unused turkey gun and set it up more appropriately for home defense.  He asked if I knew where to source a shorter barrel and longer magazine tube for his Mossberg.  No problem, I told him, I've already got one you can have.  

I'd bought a pistol grip only Mossberg 590 several years earlier than this.  At that time, a factory Shockwave wasn't even an option, but you could find the parts reference numbers online to call them up, and they might let you order a 14 inch barrel and all the associated hardware.  I'd picked one up with the intention of setting it up in that sort of configuration, but I only got as far as replacing the standard pistol grip before life got in the way, and I never bothered with the rest.  

So, I look online and see that OP is now selling complete 14 inch kits. Great!  I tell Dad he can have the 20 inch barrel and full length magazine tube off of mine to tactical up his turkey gun, and I place my order, excited that I'm finally going to set up my stupid meme gun like I originally wanted it.  While I'm shopping, I also order an insert to use mini shells, and a nice laser for it too.  Might as well do it up properly. 

I get a brief hiccup in the next day or two when either OP or my bank had an issue with billing me while shipping to my Dad's house, and I get that all resolved, but apparently during that time my barrel kit goes on backorder.   Whatever, I wasn't in a rush anyway, and it can't be that long for something so popular, right?   The rest of my order ships and arrives just fine, but the barrel kit is just continually delayed over and over.  It was only by a week or two at first, then they sent an email saying estimated ship date would be in 6 months, and then I never heard from them again. 

Until a week ago.  Took a little back and forth as my CC info was out of date, but my complete 14 inch barrel kit finally arrived today, to complete the rest of the order that originally arrived on August 2nd, 2023.  I'm not into any r/NFA stuff, but I feel like I can empathize when they talk about waiting periods.

My fiance is free to stop at the post office and send the money order, but if we do that it's obviously going to have her name on it not mine. We live together so our address is at least the same.

In 2022, I was in a heavily abusive relationship. One day, I felt unsafe and my mental health was in the gutter due to my now ex boyfriend, so I called 911, and this resulted in a 74 hour hold. Guns were not involved in this situation whatsoever, and I've never had the desire to harm myself or anyone else with a firearm. 

Now, this stay happened in Indiana. I moved back home to my home state; South Dakota, in October 2022. 

I tried to buy a gun in 2023 for self-defense and target practice. I answered ""yes"" to the ""have you ever been in a psychiatric facility"" question on the background check, and I was denied.  

I've grown up around guns, and I was on a shooting sports team when I was younger. I would like to get something for self-defense and target practice, but now I have no idea if I can ever make this happen now. 

Can I appeal this? Or am I just screwed? If so.. where do I even start? This process is so confusing.. any help is greatly appreciated! ","guns",25,"https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/1kf51uv/5150_and_gun_purchases/"

Springfield Echelon 4.0c

CZ P09c Nocturne

Both were amazing! I also liked the Walther PDP compact, but TO ME the Echelon edged it out - super okay if you don't agree.

In the end it turned out my wife and dog were watching tv in the living room, th dog had to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night and my wife accidentally slammed the patio door letting him out.

LESSON. The lesson I learned is that eventhough I had previously tested my red dots brightness in total darkness, I did not account for the fact that my eye would be light sensitive if I'm just awaking from sleep. Same as if you turn on the bathtoom light on in the middle of the night your eyes will be overloaded.

SOLUTION. 1x Prism. The red dot brightness has to be turned so low for low light that its not visible during the day OR so bright for day that it overloads my eyes at night.
The prism can be set low for night but is still visible in daylight bc the reticle is etched into the glass. 
I have two 1x prisms on other guns. A PCC and AR and I love them. 

I know some will suggest a red dot that self-adjusts brightness based on ambient light conditions.

It was able to have scope mounts drilled for it, no rail. Had a brass looking butt plate and not quite a full stock. The fore and butt were, as I remember it, separate. But this was also 20+ years ago. 

I got to thinking about it a bit ago, and it was the last gun I used when I shot my last deer. And I would love to have one.  I'm pretty sure it went to an aunt or uncle when grandad died, it's possible my dad has it though. I haven't asked him, but probably will next month when I see him. Dad don't like talking about guns over the phone. 

It was probably bought no later than the late 80's or mid 90's. I last shot it around 1999-2001. But it honestly could have been a much older gun than that. 

It's entirely possible it's the Ruger, but all pictures I see of that one, just don't seem to fit what I remember.

I was wondering if anyone had recommendations between selling to [guns.com](http://guns.com), [cashforguns.com](http://cashforguns.com), [cashmyarms.com](http://cashmyarms.com)

I sold a pistol at [guns.com](http://guns.com) a while ago and they offered a few hundred more than any local shop. Consignment and,   selling private party..  either of those options give me the heeby-jeebies. I don't like, sales...    having to haggle, or,    I dislike being rapacious or I don't even know..

Given that guns are weird in terms of law,    I'd like to sell the rest of these in a similar fashion (Get a loose appraisal, get sent a thing to mail them, and be done with the ordeal.)

SO;  if anyone has any insight or personal experience with any of these companies I'd love more information!    I may sell my rifle as a test case,    then if it goes well, sell the collection for my mum. ugh..     sales is one thing that irks me,   markets, capitalizing on supply and demand... so getting a decent price and low hassle compared to,     walking around at a gun show or idk.. Posting online and meeting someone in a parking lot :D     I almost sold my pistol that way.   uh,   so yeah. If anyone has experience with those 3 sites,     or another site they'd recommend that would have the..   safe transport, and legitimate ability to make the transaction;   i'd appreciate it!

  
OH,   if anyone knows of a place where one can get a decent review (beyond yelp, bbb, google,   that companies can't buy fake reviews for or pay to have bad ones removed)   i'd totally dig that too. Bless!","guns",14,"https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/1ke1r5w/selling_guns_online_advice/"

After watching The Expanse the combat suits that the Martian Marines had got me thinking- could you realistically make a gun that goes onto your wrist?

1.	P365: Its super thin and small making it very easy to carry. There are a TON of aftermarket accessories for it and I can change it to be a larger firearm if I need (due to the fire control unit being the serialized component). 

2.	Shield Plus Carry Comp: This firearm is a bit longer than the P365 but thats due to the port which I like the idea of to reduce the snappiness of the small frame. 

3.	Smith &amp; Wesson CSX E-Series: This is a small hammer fired pistol that is made to fit the carry 1911 category. Ive never shot or held it so I am unsure how it feels. Has anyone shot it and can compare it to the other pistols on my list?

Does that mean I'm not supposed to be in possession of the guns I own now? Will ATF come knocking at my door? A lot of question were swirling in my head and made me nervous beyond belief. I ended up going to the FBI website with my NICS # and filed a history report to find out why I was denied. Turns out I was classified as a ""fugitive fleeing justice""...I didn't know where to go from there, this had to be a mistake...right? The worst part is the answer was vague, where was I fleeing justice from? Welp, turns out that I received a traffic ticket out of the state of Georgia (I live in Texas) that was never taken care of. Long story short, I received a traffic violation that my trucking company at the time was supposed to take of for me and they never did, I'm kicking myself in the ass for not making sure this was taken care of. Well I contacted the county in Gorgia, paid the $400 ticket and the warrant was recalled...but where do I go from here? The pawn shop I tried to buy the gun from isn't any help, I tried to ask them and they are clueless. I tried to contact a few lawyers but none seem interested. So I figured I would turn to trusty reddit for legal advice lol...But in all seriousness, has anyone here happen to go through this before? How did y'all handle it? What should I do next? If anyone has gone through something similar and resolved this, I would love to hear about your experience. Thanks guys.

\*\*\*EDIT\*\*\*: Ok guys, so I submitted a firearms related challenge and emailed the FBI a document from the county saying my warrant was lifted, within 24 hrs the FBI reached back out to me with this response.

""This letter is in response to your challenge. You were denied at the time based on the following: Title 18, United States Code, Section 922(g)(2): A person who is a fugitive from justice. The prohibitor is indicative of an active felony or misdemeanor warrant which has to meet three criteria: · The person is subject to a current or pending/potential criminal prosecution or criminal testimonial obligation (e.g., expert witness, material witness, victim, or informant); and · The person has left the state; and · The person has done so to avoid prosecution for a crime or to avoid giving testimony in a criminal proceeding (e.g., expert witness, material witness, victim, or informant). Although you were prohibited when this transaction was initiated, the FBIs Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division was able to determine that you are not prohibited at this time. If you attempt to purchase in the future, a complete National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) background check will be conducted to ensure there are no additional prohibitions.""

My Streamlight TLR-7A has been on my CZ P-01 for a little under 3000 rounds over the past 2 years. Recently I noticed the head unscrewing a little while shooting, causing it to not turn on. Quick Google said the o-ring was probably old, so I sent Streamlight an email asking for a new one. They asked for my name and address and I had a new o-ring in my mailbox a few days later.

He is used to buying through a licensed dealer, and registering the gun, etc. where that is all required.

Is it truly as simple as him handing me the gun and it's mine? Is there a way to voluntarily register the gun in my name? He wants it out of his name if he won't be in possession of it, which makes sense.

I have been scrolling through posts and old pricing where people have found the gun for anywhere between 300 to 450 USD (new and used). 

I have been searching through local store listings in my state as well as searching online through gun deals and see the prices frequently being between 600 and 700. There are some listings in the mid-high 500s (that includes a used one I found locally). 

I am a little perplexed and trying to figure out what happened. Have firearm prices shot up in the past few months? Is this a trade thing? Do people actually buy Steyrs now in the US lol?

And then I downloaded the reference photo and it doesn't fit the dimensions. In the corner menu within the Viewport, at the bottom, you can see the cube's dimensions. They are exactly as the website lists, however, putting the reference photo over it (the bottom reference photo), it doesn't fit. The top one, I had to stretch it to fit. 

I have done this with three websites and none have accurate dimensions and all of them have a bit of different values and no reference photos fit.

"2025-05-10",1746875954,"Left Eye Dominant, Right or Left Handed Bolt? (Also: What Contour?)","I'm looking to buy a bolt, but can't decide on a right or left handed one. I always shoot right handed for pistols and left handed for rifles/shotguns. It's always awkward when I shoot bolts standing because I have to remove my support hand to rack the bolt and then re-align my shot. It's fun shooting old milsurp bolts, but never really feels ""right"". I've seen people recommend levers of which I own three and they are fine, however I'm looking into trying to build something for a kind of hunting/precision shooting for fun kind of thing. Will probably be used mostly for bench shooting, however I'd like the option to take it out hunting.

I feel a right handed bolt would be better than a lefty when prone/benched as I wouldn't really need my support hand to hold the end of the rifle up so I could use it to more quickly run the action. However I feel a left handed rifle might be easier standing as I could keep my right hand supporting the end of the rifle and work the action with my left. I know a replacement chassis would also be a pain to find for a left handed rifle. I know when I run a right handed bolt and keep my left hand at the ready while racking the bolt with my right hand it can come pretty close to nicking the left hand. I do plan to run a pistol grip instead though so I won't have to work about my hand being in the way of the bolt when cycling.

If your a lefty, what do run with? Do you find certain scenarios easier with one side than the other. I feel like running a right handed rifle would be easier in the long run as parts would be easier to find, however if you feel there is a large enough benefit then I might just have to be willing to put in the extra effort to make a left handed bolt be the choice.

Whilst on the subject which contour do you feel would give the best balance to lighter weight, but can be shot for a decent string without opening up too much. I plan to shoot it more benched than anything, but would also like the ability to take it out the field every now and again. So cutting some weight would be nice. No bull barrels or anything like that, but with all the different pulma and varmint and such it's hard to decide what the best one to go with would be.

Private sales are legal in Arizona. Should I ship the gun to FFL and transfer it to me? Sorry if I sound like an idiot, I just like guns and the safety they provide for my family. The rifle is a BRN 180 with a 112 upper. Takes a 30 round magazine. ","guns",36,"https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/1kiuzmo/question_about_moving_from_arizona_to_maryland/"

"2025-05-09",1746818182,"My daughter wants to bedazzle one of my ARs. What glue?","So my 14 yr old daughter bedazzled her calculator for school ( yes it looks like my old ti83 and her 9 yr old hand me down phone probably is 15x smarter). She did an amazing Job! She wants to do one of my AR 15s. AND I'm totally ok with it.  HECK I put on green grips and furniture to zombiefy a AK DRACO years ago and had my first ever gun (a security/police used p220 which had tons of holster wear spots) dipped with a weird red and black that looks awesome, so I'm fine with it.  
My question is, the gems come with some 3000 glue or something. Use that or something else? 

Keep in mind i know my wife hates my ""black"" rifles and I built two thinking that someone else would win an election a couple big elections ago and I could sell them like hot cakes. So that didn't happen.

 They both have been safe queens more or less so then maybe my daughter might get more interested in shooting w me. 
 The other question i have is do I have her bling out the plum crazy (plastic lower) or the metal lowered one? 

Yep, I know it will look like some call of duty/ fortnite gun but it will keep two wonderful women in my life happy and I'll never be forced to sell it! Heck I'll proudly rock it at the next target outing! I'll let her do some mags too soo again the question comes up, which to bling, metal or plastic ones?

"2025-05-09",1746815724,"PSA Dagger Frame - Hang Fire Trigger Problem?","I just got a complete PSA Dagger full sized frame because I had a spare aftermarket complete slide sitting around and they were on sale for $39. Right out of the gate, the trigger is hang firing for lack of a better term when the trigger is held to the rear and the slide is cycled. The trigger has an audible/tactile reset when this happens, but the next trigger pull is delayed, taking anywhere between 1 and 15 seconds of holding the trigger to the rear with constant pressure to release the striker and fire. It does not do this if you pull the trigger and release it prior to cycling the slide. Doing so resets the trigger as normal. 

It has smoothed out a little, taking a little less time after 100+ cycles, but still seems to be a problem. Ive read that there are issues with the trigger resetting when using a non-PSA slide on a dagger frame, but those problems seemed to cause dead triggers, not delayed firing.

Any idea what it could be? ","guns",2,"https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/1kipt8u/psa_dagger_frame_hang_fire_trigger_problem/"

Let's say you buy a gun online and it gets shipped to your FFL. Well you go to your FFL and there is something wrong with it when it arrived. How bad would this ""wrong"" have to be for you to flat out refuse transfer and how would the FFL that recieved it go about it? I once got a Beretta Bobcat and the safety was SUPER hard to move, FFL recommended I give it a good cleaning (like I do with all new guns anyway), and I accepted transfer. I get home and it won't field strip. Give Beretta a call, send it in, and get it back saying the slide was out of spec.

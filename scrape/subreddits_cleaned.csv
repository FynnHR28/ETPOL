"if americans embraced winter more - we wouldn't be living in such odd locations and would be massively more climate resiliantthere's a lot of hoopla on this channel about disasters and why people live in these spots that are disaster prone like the la hills. drilling down into peoples actual mindsets though, the biggest thing most americans actually fear - is a snowstorm. they'll put up with absurd amounts of other risks just to get away from the snowflakes. when i lived in atlanta for 2 years, i discovered a lot of people put atl on their list because further north, there was the possibility of snow (like more than this last storm) and that was simply unacceptable. like kentucky isn't exactly an icebox, but it was out of consideration for a massive chunk of americans because it snows there. the vast majority of the godawful risky urban development that the us has is specifically in the no snow zone. that's how florida, phoenix, and socal spawned into such massive places with populations way above what would be normal. most of the western us, which is actually the least risky disaster wise (floodplains should never be underestimated as asheville displayed), is off peoples list due to the fact that the bulk of the area actually has a long winter period. the western us is a lot colder than it's eastern latitudes due to elevation. the ironic thing is winter has never been easier. think about it, pretty much every car is awd. how did those rear wheel drivers do it in the past? look at what they had for winter clothes in the 60's. the stuff was crap! wool and rubber boots. the winter gear we have today is cheap relatively and simply amazing. i've never been actually cold while out snowmobiling. winter nightly lows are fastest warming metric of all climate. it really isn't as bad as it used to be. minnesota used to be a wasteland of cold where -40s were something that happened in the winter. that's godawful temps, and they really don't happen anymore up there. look at this last vortex, it was a breeze compared to the 2014 one, which really sucked (we visited mn when it happened). the reason beetles are chomping through the boreal spruce and lodgepole in the rockies is the absence of -40f temps, again, gone. so, i believe one of the most impactful thing we can do to influence people to make better climate decisions is to advocate for winter actually being an enjoyable season and combating this irrational fear that surrounds the season. if people lived in better locations, that would fix so much of the crisis that is climate change for the us.",climatechange

"how do greenhouse gases absorb so much radiation when they're so rarely found?i was hoping this forum could give me an intuitive explanation for this problem. i understand that about 90 of terrestrial radiation is absorbed by greenhouse gases. i also understand that about 50 of terrestrial absorption is done by h2o, which leaves the other 50 to be done by co2, o3, and ch4, which constitute, in combination, approximately only 0.04 of the atmosphere's mass (99 of that being co2, which itself only accounts for 20 of absorption). how is it possible that only 0.04 of the atmosphere accounts for the absorption of 45 of terrestrial radiation? i've read some answers along the lines of ""due to their triatomic structures, these molecules are able to change their symmetries and 'bend' and 'stretch' to absorb photons over a large range of wavelengths."" this is quite unsatisfying, and not just because i am somewhat weak on the physics of what this means, but also because it doesn't do much to quell the intuition that light, being as small as it is, ought not to be able to be absorbed so consistently by something that is found in the atmosphere so rarely, regardless of its ability to ""stretch and bend."" when i imagine this in my head, i sort of imagine it from the perspective of a photon, who sees the sky as a net through which it aims to transcend such that the concentration of ghgs corresponds with how large the holes in the net are. hence, given a concentration of 0.04, my intuition is that the rate at which photons encounter these gases on their way to space ought to be low, and certainly not 45. just a disclaimer: i don't need reminding that human intuition did not evolve to account for the absorption properties of invisible molecules; i'm perfectly willing to accept my intuition is wrong! buti haven't been able to locate many sources online that really go into the physics of this phenomenon, let alone intuitively. so, if anyone could help with this, i would be very appreciative!",climatechange

"how to save your home from fires, and how to build a home that won't burni've been watching the l.a. fire scene, and it shocked me to a point, i had to find solutions. to my surprise, they weren't hard to find? for people who currently have homes, most likely they are made out of wood, it might be covered in plaster, and insulated i hope? i don't know why wood has been the chosen material to build homes, wood is extremely vulnerable to fire, but if that's what you're living in, here's a few ways to protect it if there's a fire coming near. get an extensive sprinkler system, or buy a bunch of cheap sprinklers and diy a system all around your house, and any extended property like a garage -install the sprinklers especially on your roof. then you might want to get something that will hold quite a bit of water, so if you're faucets inside stop flowing, you have your private reserve at the ready. if the fire comes near, turn your sprinklers on and saturate your home, the roof sprinklers are the most important, make sure they're going full blast, and leave it on, even if you have to evacuate, leave the sprinklers on... it should save anything that is soaked, fire won't burn that. the other option if you don't want to use water is to get a tank of fire retardant, and put that through the sprinkler system, for extra security. for anyone rebuilding, for crying out loud, don't use wood to build your new house! use bricks, stone, concrete, use building material that is fire resistant. those materials will hold together for a long time, but while you're at it, make it earthquake proof as well, yes that can be done, it's a matter of stacking things in a pattern, they might sway a little in a quake, but they'll come out standing strong. make sure the roof is fire proof, and don't plant anything around the house, put plants in fireproof planters all around the house, and give it fire resistant insulation, you should wind up with a safe haven to call your new home. the best way to live in this land, is to get to know the environment you're living in, and build according to what you might encounter? i don't understand the people who build houses in tornado alley, or directly on a fault line? or at beach level in tsunami territories? i haven't figured out the practical ways to advise them yet, so i'm going with my friends in california, and giving my learn not to burn advise. anyone have any ideas i didn't mention? i'd love to hear from you?",climatechange

"writing a book about climate change solutionsive never posted in this subreddit before, but ive been following for a little while. ive noticed that most of whats posted is about the problems and the urgency needed to act, but i also understand that a lot of people are fatigued by the doom and gloom of it all. im canadian, though not a climate scientist, but about 4 years ago i started writing a book in my spare time about how we can prepare and address climate change using current technology and do it in a way thats economically viable. its basically intended to be a realistic climate action plan where we actually do something about it instead of just taxing people more to try and change spending habits. ive also researched heavily into the costs and revenue potential to see how it could be done. im hoping to finish the book this year, and im also publishing it for free online so it can be shared easily before i make hard copies. is there appetite for a book like this or are we too far gone at this point for people to care? im going to finish it either way, but im curious if theres interest out there.",climatechange

"greenhouse effect versus adiabatic lapse ratehi there, i always had the intuition that the atmosphere would produce an insulating effect, even without the presence of greenhouse gases (ghgs). i understand that, as a perfect blackbody radiator, the earth's temperature can be calculated to be -18 degrees (assuming the 239wm2 measured terrestrial output power is correct) via the stefan boltzmann equation, and that the absorption and re-emittance of terrestrial longform infrared radiation by ghgs creates an warming effect. my question is, what other factors produce warming effects at the surface of the earth, and what percentage of the total thermal increase can be ascribed to the presence of ghgs? someone told me that the adiabatic lapse rate has a heating effect, quote: ""as air rises, it expands and cools without exchanging heat with its surroundings. this establishes a vertical temperature gradient that retains heat near the surface, even in a hypothetical scenario with no ghgs. the adiabatic lapse rate, , is governed by: g cp where g is the gravitational acceleration and cp is the specific heat capacity at constant pressure. this provides a baseline insulating effect independent of atmospheric composition, meaning earths surface temperature would still be higher than 255 k even in the absence of ghgs."" is this true? and, if so, is there a way to calculate the warming effect produced by the adiabatic lapse rate?",climatechange

"question about doomsday global heating mapprojectionsfirst of all, i think climate change is real and is a problem even aside from human activity. on top of that, i think anthropogenic climate change is real as well and is also a problem. so, this isn't a post by some denier or whatever. but, i see these posts and maps and articles talking about how a 3-4 degree global temperature increase will basically render almost everything south of canada or siberia a desolate arid wasteland. and that doesn't make sense to me. we are currently in an ice age, and are on the warming swing of an ice age, and human activity is exacerbating that warming for sure, but the plant has been way warmer at different times in the past, and we don't see the world as an arid mad-max style desert. if anything, we see a world that is significantly more dense with vegetation and large swathes of the world effectively becoming a perpetual rainforest for millions of years on end. where is this notion that the world getting hotter means it will all turn into a desert coming from, rather than what seems to be the more likely scenario to me, which is that a lot of lands that are now quite temperate become more similar to tropical and sub tropical rainforests. it's not like the water goes away. and with ever smaller ice caps there is only more and more water being dumped into the system. so it seems to me the real impact to human habitation is land loss to rising sea levels and water tables. not a global drying out. seems to me like things would get very got and very wet. not hot and dry.",climatechange

"wind power collapse ukwind power collapses to less than 1pc of uk electricity calm weather leaves britain highly reliant on ageing fleet of gas-fired power stations jonathan leake 22 january 2025 2:22pm gmt wind power has collapsed to less than 1pc of britains electricity supply as some of the stillest weather in years hits the uk and europe. the dunkelflaute spell sent winter wind farm output to what is thought to be its lowest since 2015 when there were far fewer turbines. near-zero wind speeds and low temperatures have left the uk dependent on france, norway, belgium and denmark to keep the lights on through much of today, with the countries collectively supplying more than 10pc of the uks electricity through undersea cables. it follows tuesdays attack on wind farms by donald trump, who halted developments in us waters and called the turbines inefficient, ugly and a threat to wildlife. the lack of wind also left britain highly reliant on its ageing fleet of gas-fired power stations which were providing over 60pc of its electricity. it meant that the national energy system operator (neso) had to call in expensive extra capacity. at around noon on wednesday, the connahs quay 2 power station was offered 745 per megawatt hour to start generating. advertisement the normal price of power is around 100. the extra costs of that power will eventually find their way onto consumer bills. similar spells of minimal wind output have hit before, for example in may 2020, but almost always in spring and summer when warm weather means demand is far lower. on winter days, uk electricity demand is typically around 35gw in the daytime but peaks at around 45gw in the evening. on very cold evenings it can hit nearly 50gw. the uks 12,000 wind turbines typically provide around 10gw, but output can reach 23gw when the wind is blowing strongly. however, for most of wednesday morning the output of all 12,000 turbines was under 200mw roughly what could be expected from just 30 large turbines on a windy day. it meant wind farms were effectively contributing nothing to the uk power system and on a cold winter day when evening demand was yet to peak. the met office had warned of the likely calm spell giving neso time to make preparations. it said winds over the uk, north sea and neighbouring countries were set to be extremely light until thursday evening, after which storm eowyn was due to arrive, with winds up to 100mph predicted on friday. asked what preparations it was making for the calm spell neso said: we cannot provide a running commentary on the operation of the electricity network. advertisement however the last few days were among the tightest seen on the uk power grid in recent years. ratcliffe-on-soar in nottinghamshire, the uks last coal-fired power station, would have provided an extra 2gw of power enough to offer a comfortable safety margin, but it was shut down last september to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. richard tice, the reform uk energy spokesman, said: trump is right about wind turbines they are ugly expensive and harm wildlife including huge marine life damage. people who invest by relying on subsidies for their long term viability should not be surprised that eventually people wake up and say this is wrong. i have no sympathy. short-term subsidies may be justifiable but not long-term ones for investors.",climatechange

(banks can service lower ticket sizes as they can be underwritten automatically) i will create a debt crowdfunding platform where retail and institutional investors can participate and earn better returns than government bonds. commercial building owners benefit via simpler and cheaper access to capital. what concerns do you all see in this idea? would love to hear your thoughts. thanks in advance.",climatechange

"an example of why it's so difficult to get people on board.i live in canada and yesterday, we had a big snowfall. i was outside this morning clearing the snow and i saw something that is a perfect example of one of the major obstacles to getting people on board with fighting climate change. my neighbour came here from italy easily fifty years ago. he's of an older generation from the old world, he has a specific world view that can be quite backwards at times. this is common for older folks, especially if they lack an education. what i saw, was him start up his snowblower, despite having no need to. he had already cleared his snow last night and was using it to attack tiny bits that would easily be handled with a shovel, even for a senior. he then let it idle for ten minutes while speaking with another neighbour, pumping out poison all the while. he was outside because it's a social event for retirees: they get outside because they want something to do, and they want to socialize with everyone else who's clearing their snow. even worse, he's let the engine idle while chatting and the reason for that is very simple: he's not thinking about global warming. it's just not something he would consider. he's interested in feeling like a man, using his power tools without any consideration of the consequences. the ironic thing is that he's an extremely avid gardener, and would probably be the first to complain if climate change affected that. the obstacle here is to get people to keep climate change in the back of their mind. we need to overcome a lifetime of neural pathways, forging new ones, which takes a lot of time and effort, even when the subject is willing. of course, this won't be news to anyone here. we all know that awareness is step one, i just thought i'd share this as a prime example.",climatechange

"what am i missing here?somebody tell me the flaw in my reasoning. i have been learning about climate change for a long time; well over a decade, and the way i see it is as follows: 1. fossil fuel use cannot be stopped without a. crashing the global economy b. collapse of industrial agriculture c. increasing temperature by the reduction of particulate aerosols which currently block a fraction of incoming sunlight energy because: a. over 80 of global energy usage is currently fossil energy based b. there has been no effect from current mitigation strategies emissions only continue to rise. c. electricity is only an energy carrier and not an energy source d. energy sources have only been additive substitution of one energy source for another has not been achieved or proven possible even if fossil fuels were stopped being used tomorrow the earth would continue to heat for centuries to millennia, which will initiate feedback loops increasing overall warming. equilibrium is a long way off and the effects of the current greenhouse gas forcing have not been fully realized. 2. there is no green energy transition or net zero because: a. so called green energy relies on fossil inputs when then the entire life cycle is considered. i.e. there are not solar panels, nuclear power plants, batteries, or wind turbines without fossil energy to allow for mining the raw materials and manufacturing the devices. it is not clear that the amount of raw materials required is even possible to mine from the earth. b. net zero does not account for the carbon already released into the atmosphere there is no draw down of atmospheric carbon dioxide c. carbon capture and storage is a pipe dream. in reality the technology is resource and energy intensive and cannot be scaled up to make a difference so what am i missing here? how is mitigating climate change actually possible?",climatechange

"despite progress in renewables, the best chance to curb climate change is a concerted effort to refine and then broadly adopt nuclear energy such as thorium salt reactors.small reactors, safer waste that can be repurposed instead of buried, passive failure safe and about a millenniums supply of fuel. all this could be had if thorium was developed in a way that it could be commercialised. reactors that could be just for city districts, remote communities, hospitals, container ships etc. edit: this is to function as a general response to common answers and arguments ive seen from commenters. i simply dont have time unfortunately to respond to all of them individually so im lumping it all here . those who have already made up their minds will ignore it . those who are open to the idea may find it a reason to research further . so here goes nothing : there are those who argue that these reactors are financially unviable. they are no doubt financially at a disadvantage to renewables but so were renewables during the stronger years of fossil fuels. discoveries are made, research carried out, and with time the costs invariably come down. thats true of most technologies. so this is more a reluctance to invest and ensure future generations will already get the basics ironed out because, by goodness, theyll have enough shit to deal with, without adding a second energy crisis to the mix. aside from the purely financial there is a geopolitical. most people in europe are acutely aware of what it is to be dependent on a volatile or unfriendly state for their energy needs. rare earth elements are found in a number of places the largest of which is china. those who advocate going purely for renewables such as wind and solar are basically saying that they are happy to be somewhat subject to the whim of chinas foreign and trade policies. personally, i find that unwise. not to mention that rare earth elements are in shorter supply than thorium is. recycling techniques will no doubt improve but the likelihood is that these elements will run out in much the same way fossil fuels are doing. if thorium salt reactors were developed and refined and became a standardised technology the sizeable reserves, its more abundant distribution and the fact it is 3x more plentiful than uranium mean countries like china or the us or russia wouldnt have quite the same energy monopoly they do now. put that in the context of how many conflicts have basically been based on acquiring raw materials for energy. i would very much like for my grandkids, if ever i have any, to grow up in a world where at least that reason for killing each other is taken off the table . and finally given the gravity of what climate change represents in terms of human survival let alone prosperity , i would argue that having as many tried and tested technologies on the table for future generations to use and enjoy is a good thing even if, right at this particular moment, some are more costly than others. id argue those future generations would be grateful for us at least getting that right. tldr: molten thorium salt reactors could provide a millenniums worth of energy potentially available in a safe scalable and sustainable technology that gives virtually every country access to the raw fuel without depending on another, thus adding to the climate change arsenal alongside renewables.",climatechange

ever?https:www.wsj.combusinessenergy-oilcan-a-geothermal-startup-vaporize-rock-to-drill-the-deepest-holes-ever-9f1e3c2d(https:www.wsj.combusinessenergy-oilcan-a-geothermal-startup-vaporize-rock-to-drill-the-deepest-holes-ever-9f1e3c2d) i had gpt take a deep dive on geothermal. key article insights: the article discusses quaise energy, a private geothermal startup deploying advanced gyrotron technology (millimeter-wave drilling) to: vaporize extremely hard rock formations rapidly using electromagnetic waves. potentially reach unprecedented depths (up to 7 miles) to access hotter geothermal energy (1,000f). overcome geographical constraints, dramatically expanding geothermal viability beyond current limited areas. geothermal market context: geothermal currently constitutes lt;1 of u.s. energy, making its growth potential massive. the increased power demands from ai-driven data centers and electric vehicle infrastructure are likely to boost geothermal investments significantly. geothermal energy aligns with trumps energy dominance agenda, suggesting favorable policy tailwinds. potential implications and beneficiaries: publicly traded companies that could benefit: ormat technologies (ora): currently the leading publicly traded pure-play geothermal power provider. specializes in binary geothermal plants and technology. benefits directly from increasing attention and investment in geothermal energy. strong existing portfolio and experience would position ora as a natural beneficiary, especially if quaise technology expands viable geothermal locations. rating (geothermal exposure): 910rationale: ora is well-positioned with existing infrastructure, global footprint, and advanced technology. a substantial breakthrough like quaises would significantly expand ora's market potential. chevron (cvx), devon energy (dvn), bp (bp): mentioned explicitly as investors in geothermal startups, showing interest in expanding their renewables portfolios. these companies would have the capital and expertise to scale projects quickly. however, geothermal represents a small portion of their businessesmeaning impact on stock price would likely be limited compared to their core fossil-fuel business. schlumberger (slb), halliburton (hal), baker hughes (bkr): major oil-service companies with drilling and infrastructure expertise would benefit if gyrotron technology is adopted industry-wide. would potentially supply equipment, engineering, or services if technology proves scalable. assessment of your current holding (ora): strengths: established leader and profitable pure-play geothermal business. likely to be an early beneficiary if quaise technology proves viable. limited pure-play geothermal options make ora the default choice for institutional investors seeking exposure to this niche sector. risks: could face new competition from oil majors diversifying into geothermal. if quaise's technology enables widespread geothermal generation, it may reduce barriers to entry, potentially introducing competitors. overall outlook: short-term: limited immediate impact as quaises technology still needs to be field-tested. intermediate-term: likely bullish, as increasing geothermal visibility attracts investor interest. long-term: very bullish, assuming quaise (or similar technology) proves viable, significantly expanding the global geothermal market. ora, as the industry leader, is well-positioned. overall rating for ora (geothermal exposure): 8.510 analysis of quaise's impact on geothermal as an industry: technological potential: very high. quaises tech, if successful, would represent a disruptive breakthrough. implementation risk: also high. field demonstrations needed, and technology may encounter unforeseen hurdles. economic feasibility: moderate. high upfront costs (15-25 billion for 5gw), but scalable and appealing if validated. policy support: high, especially under the current trump administration's pro-energy domestic agenda. conclusion & recommendation: bullish long-term for ora: quaises success would directly amplify ormats total addressable market (tam), allowing geothermal plants almost anywhere, dramatically enhancing the attractiveness of ora as an investment. current recommendation for ora: short-term (next 1 year): moderate bullishness (710) due to broader sector momentum. intermediate-term (1-3 years): strongly bullish (8.510) if geopolitical pressure and increasing u.s. emphasis on domestic energy production continues. long-term (3-5 years): extremely bullish (910) if quaise (or similar) breakthroughs prove economically viable, creating massive market opportunities for ormat. strategic consideration: this signals an excellent entry point or opportunity to increase exposure to the geothermal space via ora. monitor quaise closely. if the technology proves commercially viable, consider increasing positions in ora, schlumberger (slb), baker hughes (bkr), and other companies that could benefit through equipment and services in expanded geothermal exploration and infrastructure. final verdict: quaises technology: intriguing and potentially disruptive, yet still speculative. ora: well-positioned for upside from geothermals increasing visibility and market expansion. excellent hold or buy-on-dips. oil services companies (slb, hal, bkr): could also benefit indirectly from broader adoption of deep-drilling technology, albeit on a longer time frame and smaller scale compared to pure-play geothermal (ora). free https:theheatformula.substack.com(https:theheatformula.substack.com)

"coming to terms with climate anxietyi recently felt a resolution regarding my climate anxiety. i accepted that the near few hundred year future will likely hold a lot of suffering - drought, famine, disease, floods, fires across all species and organisms causing a mass extinction event. my glimmer of hope lies within the long term opportunities for biodiversity on a geological timescale. the climate is going to change drastically, species will evolve and adapt, and once nature heals our planet will be home to a significantly wider array of life. i imagine ecosystems that harness plastics and pollutants as fuel source, soil and trees that grow on complex roadways and overpasses, and birds that nest high up in abandoned skyscrapers. plants will have more carbon as food for material growth, and our polar regions will be habitable for ecological expansion. change is scary, and transition periods shake us up, just like a snowglobe. if we recognize that our few decades of inhabitation are only a blip within the billions of years of life before and after, we can be more optimistic of a future we will never see. this is not to say ""keep on polluting, it doesn't matter anyways."" i'm just offering food for thought that makes our journey a little less bleak. put effort into making lifestyle changes to reduce your impacts, but don't feel guilty when you can't. life is hard right now, and the system keeps us dependent on plastics, cars, and industries that destroy our ecosystems. none of this is your fault. live your best life in the current moment, and trust that the future will fall into place.",climatechange

"should americans actually be blamed for not riding trains if there are no viable trains to take?this post is referring more to intercity service (i.e. amtrak) as an alternative to flights and road travel, but this largely applies to regional transit like subways, light rail, commuter rail, even rapid bus service, etc. as well. sure, there's absolutely tons of totally unnecessary air travel happening in the u.s. there are 14 flights a day between the miami area and orlando, including on low cost carriers that probably don't have many connecting passengers, despite the existence of brightline. it's more comfortable, cheaper (especially after airline fees), and only about 30 minutes slower door to door. same likely goes for some city pairings on the acela express corridor. people just see a cheap 1 hour flight and assume it's the default way to travel without considering the cost to our planet, let alone the hidden time and money sinks that air travel creates (bag fees, getting there 2 hours early, etc.) compared to alternatives. however in most areas of the u.s., this is not the case. amtrak usually takes longer than even driving, and is rampant with multiple hour delays for freight trains, power outages, understocked cafe cars, dirty trains, passengers that weren't acting very safe, and more. i've encountered all of these in just 4 10-hour amtrak rides. even if you are fortunate enough to have the vacation time to regularly travel by train (which in the u.s. job market is unlikely), you are probably going to be traveling on an old diesel train that isn't operating at full capacity. there won't nearly be as much emission savings as in other countries. and it's not like these are extravagant international trips either. most of it is work trips, visiting family and friends, or just visiting nature, events, cities, and attractions all within our own country (which we should be doing more of to minimize overtourism impacts). the u.s. just happens to be a large country that requires a 6 hour flight to cross (excluding hawaii since there's also ethical considerations for vacationing there and trains and large oceans simply aren't the greatest combination). on a local scale this also goes for public transit in cities. most transit systems focus on commuters going from the suburbs to downtown and back again. have a reverse commute, a suburb to suburb commute, night shift work, errands to run during the day, or just want to go to a restaurant, the movies or something else fun after work or on the weekends? too bad, go get a car. the operating hours and routes won't work for you, and it will take 3 hours to get anywhere. and there's not much security presence either, so you'll probably feel unsafe riding. how can we help change this for the better? can we really blame people for not utilizing trains at this point? should the train really be considered a viable alternative?",climatechange

"california should stop buying geothermal electricity...for nowi work with a small electric company in a western state. we need baseload 24-7 power - solar, wind, and energy efficiency can only get us so far without radically increasing electric rates; batteries are expensive and buy you 2-6 hours, not 10-12 hours at high cost; nuclear isn't happening for at least 10-20 years (and if it does will be supply limited)...natural gas is the only economically feasible option available to us right now. what about geothermal? we would love to buy geothermal, but it is a nascent industry. there is a lot of project development risk in both the technology, transmission access, and financing. big geothermal projects are limited and the ones that we (us and multiple other utilities) start discussions with end up ghosting us because they can get more money from california utilities. but california already has pretty clean electricity per kilowatt-hour. for the dollars they spend to get to 100 carbon-free, they are paying a lot to reduce a little. they are sucking away supply-limited geothermal from other more carbon intensive states surrounding them. for the same dollars they spend to get to the gold standard, other states could reduce 2-3x as much carbon by improving the back and middle of the electric company pack. they obviously can't subsidize our carbon free power plants (even if it is more carbon and economically efficient) but if they at least stopped buying geothermal, it would lower geothermal project demand and open up supply to the rest of us, lowering project prices and overall emissions. batteries are a more decentralized technology that don't have the same geographic and transmission requirements. california could continue down that path, improving the technology and lowering prices with increased demand and resulting expanded manufacturing (like they did with solar panels) without the same impacts to other utilities... my two cents...reactions?",climatechange

"could thorium improve climate ?climate change is the result of our demand for energy. an accelerator-driven subcritical reactor (adsr) may be possible using thorium, which is more plentiful than uranium. uranium resources may last over 200 years, but less if used to combat climate change. the problem with uranium is that spent radioactive fuel requires cooling for over 100 years and remains radioactive for 10,000 years. uranium reactions persist at high power for weeks after shutdown so natural disasters can cause steam explosions by cutting coolant. uranium plants cant be built in geologically active areas and no safe storage area has been found yet for spent fuel. spent thorium fuel requires cooling for a much shorterter period and remains highly radioactive for several hundred years. thorium reserves are estimated to be 6.4 million tons and estimated 4 times more than uranium. possibly enough to last 1,000 years. thorium is not naturally radioactive like uranium. thorium must be exposed to neutrons using a particle accelerator and a lead target or other nutron source. about 95 splits releasing about the same energy as conventional uranium nuclear reactor. molten salt is used to transfer heat to power a steam turbine, which eliminates risk of steam explosions. the difference is that when the particle accelerator turns off the thirium reactor turns off. uranium does not. this means adsr thorium reactors can be built where uranium reactors cannot.",climatechange

"the year denver runs out of breath denver, the city of sunshine and powder, has always been a place that sold itself on the crispness of its air. the kind of air you could bottle and sell to new yorkers. the kind that made skiers grin and runners fly. but that air is vanishing. not invisibly, not quietly. it's being burned, smoked, and baked away. we are on track to turn denver into a city of filtered lungs and endless summers. not the sort of eternal summer that californians fantasize aboutbut the kind where the asphalt cooks your shoes, the sky takes on a beige smear from wildfires, and hospitals overflow with people whose hearts and lungs just cant take it anymore. by 2075, if we continue on the path were onthe one driven by a high-emissions scenario known as ssp5-8.5denver could be more than 8f warmer than it was at the start of the 21st century (ipcc ar6, 2021). thats not a statistic. thats your grandmother's porch melting. thats your kids staying indoors for weeks because the air is too thick to breathe. you think you know summer in denver? try sixty days above 100f. try air quality alerts not for a day or two, but for entire months. a smoke season that lasts longer than ski season. welcome to the future we are barreling toward, fueled by apathy and inertia. smoke season is the fifth season now the smoke isnt a gentle reminder that fires exist in the mountains. its a suffocating, fine-particle fog that sneaks into nurseries and nursing homes. already, wildfire smoke accounts for more than half of all fine particulate pollution in the west (o'dell et al., 2020). and when it combines with ground-level ozonea pollutant that thrives in heatthe effect on lungs, especially in kids and the elderly, becomes something out of a public health horror film (front range air quality technical advisory panel, 2022). a 2023 study from noaa found that denver's ozone pollution will likely increase in severity and duration as summers heat up (fiore et al., 2023). that's because ozone is formed when sunlight hits emissions from cars and factories. more sun. more heat. more ozone. think of it as a perverse kind of solar powerone that powers lung disease. by mid-century, denverites could experience 40 to 80 days of dangerous air quality each year, depending on how fast or slow we act now (colorado climate center, 2022). in the worst-case path, youd need a mask just to walk your dog, not for a virus but for the sky. water: the last argument of a thirsty city denver was never a rainforest, but by 2075 it may come to resemble a high-altitude phoenix. the snow that feeds the citys water supply is melting earlier every year. the rivers run shallow by august. springs come too soon. summers stretch into october. evaporation steals more water than we can save. climate scientists call it increased atmospheric evaporative demand (mcevoy et al., 2020). thats a masters-level way of saying the sky is thirstier now. it drinks the moisture from soil, trees, rivers, even your skin. in a high-warming scenario, colorado river flows could drop by up to 30 by 2050 (udall & overpeck, 2017). denver drinks from that river. so does phoenix. so does las vegas. so does los angeles. the math doesnt work. the city that sold a climate mirage real estate brochures wont mention the 110f summers, the smoke-thick skies, or the fact that your homeowners insurance might double because of fire and flood risk. theyll sell you sunshine, mountain views, and walkability. but walk where, exactly? through triple-digit heat and asthma-level air quality? this is not a livable climate. and yet, we continue to build. the cranes keep swinging, the suburbs keep expanding, and lawns still gleam under the punishing sun. we are terraforming the front range for a climate that no longer exists. we know what works. we just dont do it. the good news? we know exactly how to stop this. if the world were to aggressively cut emissions starting now (ssp1-2.6), denver might warm by only 23f total by 2075. wed still have fires and droughts, but theyd be manageable. the air might still burn some days, but not every week. our rivers might run low, but not dry. kids could still play outside. denver has begun doing some of this workelectrifying buses, promoting water-wise landscaping, building energy-efficient homes. but its not nearly enough. not when 60 of the regions emissions still come from fossil fuels and vehicle miles traveled keep rising (drcog, 2022). the case for panic maybe panic is appropriate. not the kind that paralyzes, but the kind that sparks revolution. the kind that leads to tree-planting programs in every neighborhood, to banning gas-powered lawn tools, to shifting water laws so every drop counts. the kind that gets us off the couch, out of denial, and into climate action. because in 2075, when your grandkids ask what summer used to smell like, you dont want to say: smoke. you want to say: pine needles. rain on hot pavement. the air after a thunderstorm. you want to say you remembered what mattered in time. sources: ipcc sixth assessment report (2021)(https:www.ipcc.chassessment-reportar6) noaa (fiore et al., 2023)(https:repository.library.noaa.govpdfjswebviewer.html?filehttps:repository.library.noaa.govviewnoaa49806noaa49806ds1.pdf) o'dell et al., ""estimated contributions of wildfires to pm2.5 in the western u.s.""

"ai might be a net positive for the environmentplease take all calculations and sources with a grain of salt, as such things are generally hard to quantify. i also would be happy to get corrected if i made mistakes or misrepresented some data. i tried to balance myself out with sources from both sides. i'm an ai doomer myself, but at the same time i think that many environmental claims is an overreach. so i'm obviously have some biases. imo there are three main talking points about ai, harming the environment: - energy consumption - carbon footprint and greenhouse gases (ghg) in general - water scarcity and pollution i sorted sources about negative impacts at the top of each section and about negative impact - on the bottom. 1. energy consumption as of 2024, data centers accounted for about 1.5 of global electricity consumption, with ai accounted for 15 of total data centre energy demand accordingly.(https:www.scientificamerican.comarticleai-will-drive-doubling-of-data-center-energy-demand-by-2030) therefore we can say that ai itself is using around 0.225 of global energy reserves. predicted share of energy usage for data centers by 2030 is between 5 and 20.(https:www.scientificamerican.comarticleai-will-drive-doubling-of-data-center-energy-demand-by-2030) considering that ai it still on it's growth and can take over up to 50 of all data center's resources, in 2030 it can be responsible for 2.5 up to 10 of all energy consumption (20 up to 90 times more, than of now) which is quite radical, but not unrealistic prediction. nevertheless, as of right now, ml-related technologies is able to provide 15 improvement in grid efficiency and 1020 increase in battery storage efficiency(https:www.mdpi.com2073-443315101250) and 2030 relative efficiency gains in cell and module r&d.(https:journals.sagepub.comdoifull10.11770958305x241256293) same magnitude of efficiency gains is also the case for all clean and non-clean energy sources, by forecasting the weather and autoadjusting solar panels, micromanaging power grids and plants, predicting deposits of fossil energy sources and so on. i think safe to say, that estimated energy gain overall will equal to or most likely surpass even the most pessimistic prognosis of 10 energy consumption from ai alone by 2030. 2. carbon footprint and ghg in general according to icef report from november 2024(https:www.icef.go.jpwp-contentthemesicefpdf2024roadmap15icef2.020ghg20emissions20from20aistand20alone.pdf), (this link will download pdf file!) ais total ghg emissions are estimated at 100300 million tonnes co2, or roughly 0.2-0.6 of global emissions. with that, operational emissions are around 0.05 while manufacturing servers, chips, facilities, model trainings and life-cycle impacts make up the remainder. at the same time ai can reduce global ghg emissions by 510 by 2030(https:thesustainableagency.comblogenvironmental-impact-of-generative-ai), via optimized grids, predictive maintenance, and smart agriculture and, additionally, cuts of up to 5.3 gigatons co2 (another 510 of current emissions)(https:www.sciencedirect.comsciencearticlepiis277242712200122x) - through applications in transport, buildings, and supply chains. one specific research(https:www.nature.comarticless41598-025-97110-3) (from month ago) from china indicates, that correlation between of ai adoption and of reducing carbon footprint (1 and 0.0395 accordingly) is quite sustainable and universal across the industries. but hard to say of this correlation will hold with future increasing aification of industries. 3. water scarcity and pollution apparently in us ai is responsible for 0.5-0.7 of total annual water withdrawal(https:oecd.aienwonkhow-much-water-does-ai-consume). if source took a data of water consumptions by data centers in general (it most likely the case, as most of the articles do so), then actual numbers will be a 15 of 0.5-0.7, which is 0.075-0.105 accordingly. considering that most of the world ai infrastructure is located in us and china, safe to say, that for the rest of the world this percentages is significantly smaller. the real concern, however, is the water pollution and separate cases of mismanagement from the corporations. quote: ""googles planned data centre in uruguay, which recently suffered its worst drought in 74 years, would require 7.6 million litres per day, sparking widespread protest.""(https:sdgs.un.orgsitesdefaultfiles2024-05gupta2c20et20al.ais20excessive20water20consumption.pdf) (this link will download pdf file!) recent article from politico(https:www.politico.comnews20250506elon-musk-xai-memphis-gas-turbines-air-pollution-permits-00317582) about air pollution from xai data center is also seems to me as a fair critique. here is a positive aspects: ai irrigation can reduce water usage by 30-50 while increasing yields by 2030 (which is 58 savings of global agricultural withdrawals if deployed worldwide).(https:www.sciencedirect.comsciencearticlepiis2772375525002151) ai acoustic and pressure-based leak detection is already working and have 8097 accuracy, cutting non-revenue water losses by 2040. given that networks lose 30 of supply globally (the most distant and arid places usually suffer the most), ai is saving 612 of treated water. (https:www.waterrf.orgserve-file2024iws-challenge-solutioncase-western-cwd.pdf) (this link will download pdf file!) same goes for demand forecasting, pump optimization, water quality assessment and many other projects, totaling up to 12 of the saved fresh water worldwide (if implemented worldwide as well, which is not the case for now). some of this solutions is already implemented and working, although mostly in the water hungriest areas, like parts of africa, china and india. i think it's crucial to point out, that most of the water scarcity-related suffering is mostly occurring far from data centers and their water sources. and this problem is more of a logistical one (how to transport the water to the arid areas), than of sheer amount of fresh water world supplies. i want to highlight, that ai still have an impact on environment and it's a right thing to strife for reducing the environmental impact in any area. but i believe that misinformation, toxicity and alarmism eventually will harm the both sides of this debates.",climatechange

"why aren't we celebrating progress on climate change?it seems to me that we would rather be pessimistic than optimistic. like ""oh we are not doing enough"" or whatever. but why aren't we celebrating what has already been done? let's not forget that just 50 years ago rivers would catch fire (see cuyahoga river fire(https:www.smithsonianmag.comhistorycuyahoga-river-caught-fire-least-dozen-times-no-one-cared-until-1969-180972444), and it was a perfectly normal occurence too). smog was everywhere in the cities. coal plants released a lot of soot into the atmosphere. let's not forget that 20 years ago, at the turn of the millenium, scientists were predicting that the temperature would rise 4-5 degrees by 2100. like think about this. does this seem absurd to you? now we got people complaining about getting to 2 degrees above pre industrial levels by 2100 which is not good but mind you probably won't happen anyways. let's not forget that just 10 years ago we were talking about how solar panels will never be economically viable and will only be for environmentalists. that electrical vehicles had too many shortfalls to be used by everyday people for everyday uses. that coal will still be used for the coming future (now granted it's replacement natural gas isn't exactly better but at least it doesn't create smog). we are changing. and we are changing fast. ev adoption is at record highs, especially in china. when i went there before covid (feb 2019) you'd be lucky to find an ev car that wasn't a taxi or a bus. i would say maybe only 1 in 20 or so (very very vague guess) were evs. now? the roads are a lot quieter (visited again in mar 2025). the air is a lot cleaner. the infamous chinese smog? gone. just gone. and this has barely been a few years. the increasing economic viability of evs has also made them appeal to many developing countries such as mexico and brazil. we are transitioning to solar energy at record speeds. even saudi arabia, of all countries, is making huge leaps towards renewables (now granted whether or not they achieve that is another mystery). over half of europe's energy is already renewable. china is adopting renewable energy at record speeds too with its solar adoption having increased by 1000x since the economic crisis (when the country started caring about solar). california is leading the country with green energy with over half of our energy being from renewables too. it is pretty common to see solar roofs everywhere. even red states like texas is adopting wind energy at record speeds. everywhere around the world we are adopting renewables. fast. the fight is still ongoing. we have not defeated it. but the enemy is a mere shadow of what it once was. self-combusting rivers are no longer a thing. leaded gasoline aren't in road vehicles anymore. the ozone layer is rapidly recovering after cfcs got banned. most of the bad stuff in our atmosphere half a century ago is gone. knowledge of climate change is higher than it has ever been. co2 emissions have finally plateaued and peaked in 2024. renewable adoption is happening at speeds we could have never imagined just a few years ago and it is showing zero signs of slowing down. maybe we should just stop. take a breather. and look at everything around us. it isn't as bad as we would like to believe.",climatechange

"jevons paradox: what it is and what its notjevons paradox: what it is and what its not theres a lot of confusion online about jevons paradox especially when its used to argue that making renewables cheaper somehow keeps fossil fuels alive. thats not what the paradox says. lets clear this up. --- what is jevons paradox? jevons paradox comes from 19th-century economist william stanley jevons. he observed that as steam engines became more efficient, they made coal-powered energy cheaper and total coal consumption increased, not decreased. in short: gt; making a resource cheaper or more efficient to use can lead to more demand for that same resource. example: - in the 1800s, more efficient steam engines made coal more useful. this led to an explosion in coal use and displaced older tech like waterwheels and manual labor. --- what jevons paradox is not: its not a law that says efficiency always backfires. its not a reason why fossil fuels will persist forever. and crucially, it does not apply when one energy source replaces another thats called substitution, not jevons. --- substitution is not jevons lets look at some examples of substitution cases where new energy or transport technologies displaced older ones: - cheap fracked natural gas in the u.s. displaced coal in electricity generation. gas was cheaper and cleaner, so coal plants shut down. thats not jevons thats substitution. - cheap automobiles replaced horses. nobody said, cars got so cheap that we started breeding more horses. - electric lighting replaced gas lamps and candles. we didnt suddenly consume more whale oil because leds got cheaper. - cheap solar and wind are now displacing coal and increasingly gas, because theyre becoming the cheapest sources of electricity in many markets. if jevons paradox applied in these cases, wed see more of the old resource being used. but we dont we see it being pushed out. --- so what is happening with energy today? yes, total electricity demand is rising from evs, heat pumps, data centers, and development. thats true. but that doesnt require fossil fuels to grow. it just means we need more energy and the cheapest sources will win. if fossil fuels arent being phased out quickly enough, the reasons are: - political lobbying and regulatory capture - market inertia and grid bottlenecks - subsidies that favor incumbents those are real problems but theyre not jevons paradox. --- bottom line jevons paradox says that making a resource more efficient can increase its use. it does not say that switching to a new, cheaper energy source will keep the old one alive. in fact, history shows the opposite: the cheaper resource usually wins and pushes the old one out. --- tl;dr: cheaper solar more coal. cheaper gas more coal. cheaper cars more horses. lets stop misusing jevons paradox to justify defeatism about the energy transition.",climatechange

"why do flight carbon calculators vary so much? how do we know which is the most ""accurate""? (p.s. i know it's better not to fly at all, i'm asking more out of interest to see how much of a difference it would make to break up shorter flights with overland legs vs just 1-2 longer flights)for example, let's look at an economy seat one-way for the qf33 flight from perth airport (per) to paris charles de gaulles airport (cdg), which uses a 236-seat boeing 787, takes approximately 17 hours 10 mins, and covers approximately 14,270 km (at least, that's the direct distance in a straight line between the two airports). to demonstrate my problem, here's a comparison of 17 online carbonemissions calculators (all free and don't require sign-up) for the exact same flight: so i guess my main question is: why are they all so different?? and which one, if any, should i regard as more ""accurate""? the un's own aviation agency says 0.67 tons, but a local group specifically focused on carbon emissions says 4.24 tons! that's such a big difference that it's hard to know which tools to trust... i was hoping to compare this route with a few different routes from australia to europe, to see how much of a difference it makes for one's overall emissions to cut the flights shorter and travel overland part of the way (e.g. flying perth-dubai-eastern turkey and overland onwards; or flying darwin-singapore overland singapore-bangkok flying bangkok-kolkata overland kolkata-delhi flying delhi-istanbul). i am very much aware that the least emissions-intensive option is to not travel at all (or do so as infrequently as possible), followed by chartering a sailboat halfway around the world. i am asking this question with the acknowledgement that at least some people in australia will have at least some seemingly important reasons to travel between these continents. for those who do, i'd really like to know whether the fuel saved by taking a train or coach for part of the journey makes up for the extra fuel used by having more than one take-off for multiple flights. any insight or advice appreciated, thanks all :)",climatechange

"why aren't there climate change subs in every state?would an rfloridaclimatechange or rtexasclimatechange sub, just for starters, make a difference in educating americans about climate change impacts? the thought crossed my mind when i had the following post deleted by rtexas mods: texans can save hundreds of dollars each year by switching to heat pumps gt;steve nadel(https:www.aceee.orgaboutaceee-staffsteven-nadel) is with the american council for an energy efficient economy. gt;his group analyzed how much money and energy could be saved if texas homes that currently use central ac and electric resistance heating were to switch to electric heat pumps when they next replace their systems. gt;heat pumps provide both heat and cooling. they cost a bit more up front, but theyre very efficient. so nadel found(https:www.aceee.orgwhite-paper202411transforming-texas-how-heat-pumps-can-replace-electric-resistance-heat) that making the switch would save homeowners more than 300 a year on average and thousands over the life of the system. gt;nadel: this is an enormous return on investment. texans can save hundreds of dollars each year by switching to heat pumps yale climate connections(https:yaleclimateconnections.org202504texans-can-save-hundreds-of-dollars-each-year-by-switching-to-heat-pumps) reading nadel's original article, the savings may only apply to central hvac systems using electric resistance coils to heat homes. gt;over 25 of texas households are heated and cooled by central air-conditioning systems with electric resistance coils that distribute warm air via ducts and registers. these systems are a major contributor to winter peak electric demand. while power demand in texas generally peaks on hot summer days, winter peaks during cold fronts can be just as large. gt;heat pumps are a cost-effective alternative to electric resistance heat: they cut energy use, energy bills, and peak demand roughly in half. homes and apartments can be upgraded with high-efficiency heat pumps when the existing central air-conditioning unit and heating coils need replacement. transforming texas: how heat pumps can replace electric resistance heat, reducing costs and winter power peaks aceee(https:www.aceee.orgwhite-paper202411transforming-texas-how-heat-pumps-can-replace-electric-resistance-heat) why do so many texas homes use electric resistance coils for heating instead of natural gas combustion systems? are they cheaper? any problems with nadal's analysis? if accurate, why don't more texans switch to heat pumps? with trump tariffs, will the price of heat pumps soar? are heat pumps for residential hvac systems in texas more economical if natural gas combustion furnaces are used for heating? i was surprised that over 25 percent of texas homes are heated by systems using electric resistance coils rather than natural gas furnaces. so i was curious about that, but also thought, if true, the article could save many texans considerable money. it seemed like an extremely worthwhile post. when i expressed surprise at the deletion and asked for an explanation, a mod responded: ""it reads an awful lot like a sales pitch to me."" i replied: ""what? it was an article from yale climate connections that should be very worthwhile to many texas residents. i also had questions about electric resistance central heating, which i never knew existed. no firms were even mentioned in the article, so how was it a sale pitch??? do other moderators agree with this strange excuse for removing such a worthwhile article from a highly respected climate news source??? btw, do you have some connection to the texas fossil fuel industry? i can't believe an imagined sales pitch was the real reason for removal."" the mod politely responded: ""no offense, but it read like an ad to me."" actually, i had a different thought about why the post was removed. several times in recent years, i had very localized posts about hurricane warnings deleted from a few florida subs. when i asked why, i would receive explanations such as my post was ""redundant,"" even though it had extremely worthwhile detailed information not posted on the sub. all of these deleted posts cited info from the excellent hurricanestorm experts such as jeff masters and bob henson of yale climate connections. my belief now is that mods don't want posts citing yale climate connections material because they don't want sub members exposed to the existence of yale climate connections given its emphasis on climate change, so likely politically motivated deletions given the extreme levels of climate change denial in states such as florida and texas. in other state and local subs, mods don't want climate change discussed because, like health issues, it isn't deemed a locally specific subject. so perhaps residents of individual states who are concerned about climate change could do much good by creating a climate change sub for their state. have other posters experienced deletions of posts discussing climate change in local subs? am i imagining it, or are posts from yaleclimateconnections.com(http:yaleclimateconnections.com) effectively banned in some state subs even when the post doesn't directly discuss climate change, such as my rtexas post about the cost savings of switching to heat pumps in texas?

of the main statistics used: defensive rating (drtg): an estimate of points allowed per 100 possessions by a team. lower is better defensively. winning percentage (wp): the standard measure of a team's success based on their win-loss record (wins divided by total games). higher is better. net rating (nrtg): the difference between a team's offensive rating (points scored per 100 possessions) and their defensive rating. it's a measure of a team's overall efficiency. higher is better. analysis methodology to examine the relationship between defense and winning, i calculated the correlation between a team's drtg and their wp for both the regular season and playoffs each year. i also calculated the correlation between drtg and nrtg to see how defense impacts overall team efficiency. a quick note on interpretation: since drtg is a lower is better stat, for simplicity in showing the strength of this desired relationship, the values in the tables below represent the correlation multiplied by -1. so, a higher number in the table indicates a stronger link between good defense and winning. the 'difference' column shows the change from regular season to playoffs (playoffs value - regular season value). a negative difference means the correlation dropped in the playoffs, while a positive difference means it increased. correlation between defensive rating (drtg) and winning percentage (wp) here's the results by year and phase: yearregular seasonplayoffsdifference :-:-:-:- 2024250.7950.8350.040 2023240.7510.460-0.291 2022230.7860.447-0.339 2021220.7700.657-0.113

compared to the playoff correlations in the previous years. looking at the difference column from the 201819 through the 202324 seasons, there's a pretty clear and consistent pattern: the correlation between drtg and wp dropped when moving from the regular season to the playoffs for six straight seasons. this suggested that while defense is important in the rs, its relative correlation strength with winning percentage seemed to decrease come playoff time in those years. but looking at the 202425 season, the difference is positive. based on this first-round data, for the first time in the last seven years, the correlation between drtg and wp didn't drop in the playoffs compared to the regular season but it actually went up. correlation between defensive rating (drtg) and net rating (nrtg) looking at the correlation between defensive rating and net rating: yearregular seasonplayoffsdifference :-:-:-:- 2024250.8230.9000.077 2023240.7680.578-0.190 2022230.8250.468-0.357

extremely high absolute value, even higher than the wp correlation, and stands out significantly compared to the playoff correlations in other years shown. looking at the difference column for nrtg across the 201819-202324 seasons reveals an even more drastic drop in correlation from regular season to playoffs compared to the drtg vs. wp table. this large negative difference year after year strongly suggests that in previous playoffs, offensive rating played a significantly more dominant role in determining a team's overall performance, effectively reducing the statistical impact of defense on net rating in the postseason. however, in the 202425 season, the nrtg difference is also positive, marking a dramatic reversal. playoff teams only subset to further isolate the effect of the playoff environment itself, i also calculated the regular season wp correlations only for the subset of teams that actually made the playoffs each year. yearregular seasonplayoffsdifference

relevant, especially if you look at the difference between the 202324 and 202425 seasons, but the results are more fluctuating. conclusions and possible explanations based on the data presented in the previous sections, 'defense wins championships' appears to have been statistically less supported in recent past seasons, where the correlation between defense and winning decreased in the playoffs. however, the data from the current 202425 season suggests a potential shift in this trend. one factor that many of us have noticed this postseason is the reduced foul calling by refs. if defenders are being allowed to play more physically without the whistle, defense becomes more effective and thus more correlated with preventing points and ultimately, winning. this interpretation is also potentially supported by the fact that the playoff field itself hasn't drastically changed from last year; looking at the second round teams, 7 out of the 8 teams are the same as in the 2024 playoffs, with only minor roster changes for most. it would be great if someone could do an analysis on foul rates per possession or defensive play type across recent playoff seasons to see if the numbers support this. while officiating seems a plausible explanation, are there other factors at play? given that the playoff field is largely unchanged, could the specific matchups within this group be favoring defensive teams this year? is there a league-wide shift towards more physical and defensive play? limitations as mentioned earlier, the analysis for the 202425 season is currently based only on data from the first round, which represents approximately half of the total possible playoff games. the correlation could certainly change as the sample size grows and we get deeper into later rounds. i plan to re-run this analysis once the playoffs are complete to see if this trend holds throughout. still, it's a statistically interesting start that suggests defense might be playing a relatively larger role in determining playoff wins this season compared to the immediate past.",nba

"okc thunder after game 1 loss comes down to 3 main points1 bad coaching and clock management i think most of the this sub realized okc was fouling too early and most importantly, the foul they committed with 11 seconds should not have happened. after the score, thunder were up by 3 and jokic was on the bench denver had no timeouts left. you take your chances without jokic (worst case, it goes to ot assuming okc dont foul on a made 3 pt shot). on another note, coaching staff also need to keep their rotations tight to 8-man at this stage (maybe 9 if situation warrants). they went with a 10 man rotation and nobody got in rhythm except for caruso. to be fair, jaylin williams only played like 3 mins but he was involved in critical play(s). 2 okc just does not have a second player that is consistent (other than sga). frankly, this is more concerning looking ahead denver is the first legitimate contender they faced in the playoffs this year (and dal last year). jalen williams struggled mightily in game 1 vs den and was mediocre last year vs dal. he tends to play well against badgood teams but the drop-off is apparent against elite teams (especially in the playoffs). if okc are to reach their title aspirations, he has to be elite and do it consistently. 3 rebounding obviously, jokic was a monster on the glass but aaron gordon also had 14 rebounds and 7 of them were offensive rebounds. overall, thunder got out rebounded den:63-okc:43 and gave up 21 offensive rebounds (including at critical moments in the game). thunder has size with ihart and chet but the guards really need to help way more here as chetihart will be primarily focused on battling with jokic and keeping him off the glass. other observations: alex caruso is a demon. this dude was so impressive on both ends. he ended up with 5 stl and 2 blk but could have easily gotten more if some of the deflections bounced the right way. i dont expect him to score 20 every game but his defense is going to be a problem for den. has anyone seen mpj? we got the good russ last night",nba

"is westbrook the best minimum paid player ever?this is a genuine question as i can't recall many other minimum level players having this much impact, both through the regular and postseason, ever. there have been previous guys like jeff green that have had some crucial games for their teams in the post-season, but not as often as westbrook has done. westbrook has been a big part of 4 of the nuggets wins. in the 4 wins westbrook is averaging: 17.542.81.8 on 46.338.170.6 shooting splits(56.9 true shooting percentage). he is 13 in his minutes. https:www.statmuse.comnbaaskrussell-westbrook-stats-in-playoffs-wins-this-season here are his stats overall in all 7 games: https:www.statmuse.comnbaaskrussell-westbrook-stats-in-nuggets-playoffs-wins in his worst game and the one he played the fewest minutes, game 3 against the clippers where he was 1-5 in 9 minutes, they lost by 34. in the following game where he didn't play they won by 2 with mpj stepping up big time. while having watched the games he's made big baskets in clutch situations as well as big defensive plays in similar moments as well. in game 7 at the start of the 2nd he helped ignite the nuggets to go on a run and was 16 in the quarter after playing the entire quarter having a 10232 stataline on 34 shooting, 23 from 3, and 2-4 from the line. even in game 1 of the clippers series, which is the single game bringing down his shooting stats in the wins, he was crucial in the clutch hitting 3 shots in the 4th when the game was within 1 including the eventual 3 that allowed them to go into ot. in the regular season westbrook was huge in helping keep the nuggets afloat early in the season when murray was struggling to find his form and the nuggets overall were struggling. this isn't to say westbrook isn't still heavily flawed, rather it's acknowledging he's a heavily flawed player that is only being paid 3 million this year and thus comparing him to other players that have historically been in his position. i am not including players that were bought out then signed by teams as minimum players. i don't think jordan should count either as he was owner of the wizards so took minimum salary. even if you include players that were bought out and then played with other teams i believe westbrook would still have a solid argument.",nba

"tom haberstroh on why harden disappears in high leverage games: ""i can understand why officials would be reluctant to bail him out on that play and give him an almost automatic three points. historically, hardens other-worldly ability to draw the three-shot foul tends to abandon him in game 7s.""gt;harden often seems more interested in trying to get the 3-point foul call than actually making the shot. i can understand why: its the most profitable play in the game! three free throws for a career 86 percent free-throw shooter? dunks arent even worth that much. the league changed the three-shot foul rules because of that guy. gt;but harden still gets a ton of them at least before the postseason started. in this regular season, referees gave him that call quite a bit. after the all-star break, harden tallied a whopping 26 fouled 3s while no other player registered more than 11. the clipper vet generated more three-shot fouls after the break than 28 entire rosters. gt;in a postseason setting, its a different ballgame. he rarely gets that call. especially in a slow-paced game 7 when referees tend to let the players decide the game. he certainly didnt get one on saturday. and it seemed to completely throw him off his game. gt;taking away hardens three-shot foul weapon is like taking away anthony edwards hops. theyre still really good, if weakened, players, but they have to adapt and impact the game elsewhere. and you know what? harden has done that to a remarkable extent, averaging 2.6 steals, 1.3 blocks and 7.9 assists in game 7s something no other player has done in those spots. gt;harden is a brilliant basketball player, but its entirely possible that, without a generous whistle, he gets in his own head on the perimeter. the stepbacks and flails dont work. he becomes more of a playmaking role player, which simply isnt good enough for your superstar. source(https:www.tomthefinder.compthe-mystery-of-james-hardens-game)",nba

chucks advice for chet holmgren: put some rocks in your pockets,nba
"original content some game theory why you should foul up by 3alright guys i know that obviously right now it is the popular opinion that fouling up by 3 angers the basketball gods and the thunder deserved to lose and fouling up by 3 is bad obviously the thunder lost so it is bad duuhhhhhh - but i wanted to do some calcs on a few scenarios to give you all a better idea why statistically fouling up by 3 makes sense. yes. i know basketball isn't played on a spreadsheet. yes, i know there is variance. yes, i know that my assumptions are vague and aren't perfect. yes, i know that chet missed 2 free throws and the lights were too bright. yes, i agree that the execution was bad and you shouldn't foul gordon in the back court with jokic on the bench. all i am doing here is trying to explain just a little bit why, generally, fouling up by 3 makes sense. situation: team 1 is up by 3 with 12 seconds left over the with losing team (team 2) in bounding the ball. first assumption: let's say that in bounding the ball and fouling for either team takes 3 seconds each. second assumption: three point shots when down by 3 have a 30 chance to make the shot. i understand that league avg is around 36 but when the defense knows you're shooting a 3 the odds go down significantly. third assumption: two point shots are 50. too many factors can affect this number but let's just say clutch time lowers the 54-55 league average by a bit. fourth assumption: let's say everyone is an 80 ft shooter therefore 02 odds: 4 12 odds: 32 22 odds: 64 fifth assumption: let's say the defensive team gets the rebound 75 of the time on shots from the field, and 100 on free throws (i know that it's more like 95 but there would be a rabbit hole of calcs if i give ft orebs lt;100 chance so please just assume russ isn't a superhuman every ft) scenario 1: winning team doesn't foul, losing team goes for game tying 3 with not enough time for other stuff to happen. let's ignore the flukey stuff that can happen, like a 4 point play from ivey to fire the king's coach, or stealing the in bounds after a made 3, etc... this one is simple: team 1 wins 70 of the time, and we go to ot 30 of the time. scenario 2: shooting with 7 seconds left, more outcomes could happen, obviously. we can dispute the following percentages, but hopefully we can follow the logic. missed shot (70) -gt; defensive rebound (75) 52.5 of outcomes missed shot (70) -gt; offensive rebound (25) 17.5 (after offensive rebound) -gt; made shot 5.25 -gt; missed shot 12.25 made shot (30) -gt; the leading team gets a chance to win. let's say with the game tied and 4? seconds to go, there is a 30 for the winning team to win in regulation -gt; team 1 basket is good 30 30 9 -gt; team 1 basket is no good 21 summing up these outcomes: team 1 wins 73.75 of the time, while we go ot 26.25 of these instances. scenario 3: we play the foul game. i don't expect you to go through every calc but they are here in case you want to follow along or check my work. note: i round a little bit. it is 11:00 pm. sue me. 12 seconds: team 1 fouls team 2 with 9 seconds to go 4 to still be up by 3 32 to be up by 2 64 to be up by 1 9 seconds: team 2 fouls team 1 with 6 seconds to go in the 4 of scenarios where team 1 is up by 3: t1 misses both - 4 4 .16 to still be up by 3 t1 goes 12 - 4 32 1.28 to be up by 4 now t1 goes 22 2.56 to be up by 5 32 to be up by 2: t1 misses both - 32 4 1.28 to be up by 2 t1 goes 12 - 32 32 10.24 to be up by 3 t1 goes 22 20.48 to be up by 4 64 to be up 1: t1 misses both - 64 4 2.56 to be up by 1 t1 goes 12 - 64 32 20.48 to be up by 2 t1 goes 22 40.96 to be up by 3 summing it up, with 6 seconds to go if both teams foul: 2.56 to be up by 5 21.76 to be up by 4 51.36 to be up by 3 21.76 to be up by 2 2.56 to be up by 1 let's just say that if they are up by 4 or 5, the game is cooked 24.32 win outright after 2 iterations of foul game. if they are up by less than 3, team 1 does not want to foul. when down by 1, team 2 can shoot a 2 or 3 for the win, but let's just say they'll shoot a 2 for the win 2.56 0.5 1.28 team 1 wins 1.28 team 2 wins when down by 2, i'll say there's a 50 team 2 goes for the win and 50 team 2 goes for the tie (12) 21.76 0.3 3.204 loss (12) 21.76 0.7 7.616 win (12) 21.76 0.5 5.44 tie (12) 21.76 0.5 5.44 win summing it up, out of the 21.76 chance that it is a 2 point game: 3.204 loss 13.056 win 5.44 tie so far excluding the 51.36 of 3 point games, our results: 24.32 team 1 1.28 team 1 1.28 team 2 13.056 team 1 3.204 team 2 5.44 tie 38.656 team 1 wins 5.44 tie 4.484 team 2 wins god, now we dive back in to the up by 3 scenario, but fouling with 3 seconds left 51.36 0.04 2.0544 chance still up by 3 16.4352 up by 2 32.8704 up by 1 even though in this scenario, given my original assumptions, team 1 would not go to the line again because it'd take 3 seconds to foul again, but let's pretend team 1 lost their mind and didn't take up the 3 seconds to foul team 2 a few times and there is a little time left... i know, how ridiculous would it be to foul immediately instead of after waiting a few seconds. these are nba coaches... there's absolutely no way they would foul immediately instead of telling their team to waste a few seconds hahaha no way this ever happens hahahahaha especially when team 2's forward is 75 away from the basket hahahahahahhaaha up 3 -gt; 4 or more points 1.97 up 3 -gt; 3 points 0.08 up 2 -gt; 2 points 0.66 up 2 -gt; 3 points 5.26 up 2 -gt; 4 points 10.5184 up 1 -gt; 1 point 1.315 up 1 -gt; 2 point 10.518 up 1 -gt; 3 point 21 summing it up, after team 1 goes to the line a second time: up 1 point: 1.315 up 2 points: 11.18 up 3 points: 26.34 up 4 or more: 12.49 up 4 cooked. there's only a few seconds left so final half court heave... let's say 20 to be super generous up 1 or 2 12.495 0.2 2.5 team 2 wins 12.495 0.8 10 team 1 wins up 3 26.34 0.2 5.27 tie 21.07 team 1 wins to sum it up: playing the foul game if we go along with my assumptions, team 1 win: 24.32 1.28 13.056 12.49 10 21.07 82.216 tie: 5.44 team 2 win: 1.28 3.204 2.5 6.984 god i know these equal 94.64 but i have work in the morning and took stats 8 years ago and yeah there may have been a bit of rounding the 1000th decimal fuuuuuck keeping the proportion (multiplying the above numbers by 1.05663567..) team 1 win: 86.85 tie: 5.75 team 2 win: 7.4 tl;dr given the assumptions: don't foul, last second game tier: the leading team 70 win, 30 ot. don't foul, shoot a bit early: 73.75 win, 26.25 ot. play the fouling game: 86.85 win, 5.75 ot, 7.4 lose",nba

"effort sga didn't have a bad game, he just didn't outplay jokicnote:this has nothing to do with putting down jokic, who played a great game. i think jokic is the best player in the world, and has been for quite some time. he will be compared to once simply to show a difference in what it means to be efficient. outside of that, it will be references to how well he played, and how certain stats don't show his, or sga's impact properly. this is primarily in response to the posts hating on sga and calling him a ""fraud"" (including one which seems to be retconning last years playoff run where he played very well--trust me, i was rooting for luka.) 1. sga played a very good game, and was more efficient than just ts measures. his ts was 53,which is not great. however,his ast:to was 8:1. jokic had a 6:7, and he obviously had a great game overall. there are only two ways a possession can end unsuccessfully for a team: through a missed shot, or by a turnover. turnovers are obviously worse, but for the sake of argument, let's equate the two. sga shot 12-26, and had 8:1. meaning the intended outcome was achieved 20 times, and the unintended outcome was achieved 15 times. overall, this is a positive and efficient impact. along with 7-9 from the free throw line, giving 0.5 positive outcomes per make, and 0.5 negative per miss. this becomes a23.5:16 ratioof positive to negative outcomes (this is napkin math, but the point remains) jokic for comparison shot 15-29, had a 6:7 ratio, and went 10-13 from the linethis gives us a positive outcome 26 times, and a negative outcome 21 times. (both went 2-6 from three so there was no need to add any additional 1.5x multipliers to their shot diet.) this is not to disparage jokic, who still had a more efficient shooting night overall, this is just to show that simply focusing on a one-game sample size of ts when ignoring ast:to as another form of efficiency is removing playmaking from the equation. 2. one game plus-minus is a horrible statistic when measuring overall quality and impact of a player's performance. sga was -16 in this game.this does not mean he had an overall negative impact on winning. most posts are contrasting this to jokic, but this point is about how meaningless this stat is with regards to the team itself. jdub shot 5-20, 2-9 from 3, and 4-6 from the line, with a 4:1 ast:to ratio. using the previous formula, he had 11 positive outcomes, and 17 negative. he did not have a good game.his - was -6. aaron wiggins played 14 minutes and took a single shot, making it. he shot 2-2 from the line and had 4 rebounds, one of them offensive. this is solid role-player minutes.he finished 16. on the nuggets side, jokic had the third-highest plus-minus on the team. if there's anyone out there who believes jokic was only the third-most important player to the nuggets win tonight, i'd like to offer them a trade of paul george for their first-round pick. to sum this up, this does not mean sga had a better game than jokic, or that he's the best player in the world. but it does mean that posts decrying him for arbitrary statistical measures are simply agenda-driven, and posted by people who would rather tear great players down than build them up. this is the sga equivalent of people who used to say""jokic hasn't beaten a 50-win team!!!"" nuggets fans should know first-hand how stupid that narrative was. .it's ultimately just abusing statistics without context to put others down, which is pathetic. jokic is the best player in the world, but sga is top 3(there's just a bit of a gap between 3 and 1) stats for the game: https:www.espn.comnbaboxscoregameid401769820(https:www.espn.comnbaboxscoregameid401769820)",nba

then, despite her clear protests, scott pushed hayley to her knees, and, against her will, pulled off her top. scott the pulled down his shorts, exposed his erect penis, and tried to force hayley to perform oral sex on him.' hayley was terrified and pleaded for scott to stop and tried to turn her head away from his erect penis,' the complaint claims. eventually, the complaint says, scott relented and told his victim to get up off the floor and get dressed then he unlocked the door so she could leave. scotts teammates, the lakers assistant coach, trainer and film production staff had seen him lead hayley away and then return roughly 20 minutes later, according to the complaint. by then, campbell hall staff, students and parents had departed for the day. the players and production crew were having a wrap party outside the gym where alcohol was being served, the suit says. it continues that scott gave hayley a beverage - apparently alcohol - which she threw away after one sip. she had never tasted alcohol previously. by now, hayley's mind was reeling and she was scared and disoriented. with no school staff or parents on hand, she had no way to get to her home in encino a few miles west. according to hayley's lawsuit, scott took her to his car - a red, two-door mercedes - where they sat and talked for five minutes, with the player focused on discouraging her from telling anyone about the assault. he suggested the two could hang out and gave her some lakers merchandise from the trunk of the car, including a satin gym bag with his jersey number on it. scott wore the number four for the lakers. he eventually asked a teammate, who also lived in encino, if he could take hayley home but the player - apparently recognizing the inappropriate nature of driving alone with a strange teen, responded: fk, no. im not putting that girl in my car. instead, she used a payphone to call her mother who picked her up. it was twenty years later when she learned that rumors of the assault had circulated around the school at the time, when one former student asked her: are you the girl that hooked up with byron scott? in the years that followed scotts sexual assault and battery, hayley suffered, and she continues to suffer, severe psychological and emotional distress, as well as feelings of embarrassment, loss of self-esteem, shame, and humiliation,' states the suit. source: https:www.dailymail.co.uksportnbaarticle-14677485la-lakers-legend-sex-assault-lawsuit.html(https:www.dailymail.co.uksportnbaarticle-14677485la-lakers-legend-sex-assault-lawsuit.html)",nba

"road teams are 5-0 in round two so far -- and that may be part of a larger trend of a decline in homecourt advantageteams with home-court advantage tend to win the majority of their playoff series. but we also have to remember that home teams are generally the better of the two (based on regular season record). so how valuable is the concept of home-court advantage in a vacuum? it's potentially less valuable than it's ever been before. as fans, we tend to complain that the constant ""flopping"" and free-throw hunting is ruining the product. but by and large, free throws are a lower percentage of points than they used to be back in the older days(https:www.basketball-reference.comleaguesnbastatspergame.html). the percentage of points that come via the three pointers have dramatically increased in their stead. why is this relevant? because researchers have posited that ""home-court advantage"" in a game is largely reliant on a preference from referees (who may be biased by the fans' pressure). and referees play a larger role in determining free throws than three pointers. the theory goes: if refs can't affect the outcomes of games as much as they did in the past -- then roaring fans can't affect the outcomes of games as much -- and then home-court can't affect the outcomes of games as much. if this theory is true -- then we'd expect the results of home-court advantage to have lessened over the last few years. recent studies have appeared to confirm the concept. as cited here(https:sports.yahoo.comfact-or-fiction-is-home-court-advantage-in-the-nbas-regular-season-dead-194958543.html::texthome2dcourt20advantage20has20declined,of20the20past20five20years.), home teams are winning less often than they used to, down from about 60 to 54. moreover, we have to remember that ""home-court advantage"" in the nba isn't the same as ""home-field advantage"" in a sport like football. if you're in the nfl and you're the top seed, your opponent has to come into your stadium and win on your turf in the big game. singular. game. you have home-field advantage for 1 (of 1) matchups. 100 of the time. in the nba, as we know, series are played out over the course of a 7-game series. you get 2 games at home, 2 games on the road, back to home, back to the road, and back to home for the ""decisive"" game 7. so you're not getting home-court advantage 100 of the time -- you're getting it 47 times -- 57 of the time. if that. after all, not every series is actually going a full 7 games. in fact, the stats here(https:www.nbcsportsboston.comnbanba-playoffs-game-7-history-statistics609963::textpostseason20history20says20the20finals,3820game207s20(28.825) suggest that nba playoff series only reach game 7 in about 25 of all pairings. so to summarize... if you work hard during the regular season... if you fight tooth and nail to secure a higher seed... you're rewarded with home-court advantage in one extra game (which gives you about a 4-5 better chance of winning that game), in a series that has about a 25 chance of reaching that game in the first place. should any of this be a concern? maybe not. the playoffs have been fun and competitive this year. that said, the decline of home-court advantage may be contributing to the regular season malaise. franchises have been load managing and coasting in the regular season in order to keep their stars fresh -- but also doing it with the underlying knowledge that home-court advantage is not that powerful.",nba

"theory on why the nba has been delaying the annoucement of mvp awardthe coach of the year and executive of the year awards have already been announcedmvp is the only remaining award. by tradition, the mvp is unveiled either during the first round or within the first three games of the semifinals, and the announcement sometimes takes place before the recipients next home game so that the celebration can include the fans. however, this tradition has been broken in recent years. i think the nba does not want people to guess easily who the mvp is, so that they don't watch it live. also, the announcement date has been getting later each year. in 2024, the award was announced on may 8, which was one day before okc vs. mavs semifinals game 2 at oklahoma citys home arena and two days after game 2 of the nuggets vs twolves semifinals at the nuggets home arena. some people guessed shai or luka would be mvp based on the announcement date, but they were wrong. the celebration took place in game 5 (may 12) in denver. in 2024, the nba released the award schedule ahead of time on may 6, two days before the announcement date of may 8. since the nba has not yet released the mvp announcement schedule (and they will not suddenly announce it for the sake of tv ratings), the mvp announcement will be made no earlier than may 9. today is may 7. it will likely occur around game 3 or 4 in denver. that timing will lure people to watch the annoucement live. an announcement before a game in denver might create the illusion that joki will be mvpbut the nba will likely again surprise us, as they did last year.",nba

"controversial referee scott foster makes his first appearance in the playoffs this season tonight in okc as the thunder host the nuggets in game 2foster was injured in a game in miami on march 17th, 2025, suffering a calf strain in the knicks' 116-95 win. tonight's game marks his return to the court. he has been a controversial figure throughout his 29-year career in the nba, for multiple reasons: 1. he had frequent game day interactions by text with disgraced referee tim donaghy, who admitted to gambling on nba games and was sentenced to prison after pleading guilty to federal charges. according to court records, donaghy made 134 phone calls to foster between october 2006 and april 2007. the majority of the calls lasted less than two minutes and occurred shortly before and after games that donaghy officiated and gambled on. the donaghy investigation resulted in foster being interviewed by the fbi and the nba's lawyer lawrence pedowitz declaring him innocent. 2. he's been nicknamed ""the extender,"" because teams trailing in a playoffseries have often won games he has officiated, thus lengthening the series, 3. foster's refereeing has drawn criticism from fans and players.in a survey of nearly three dozen nba players by the la times in 2016 and a separate anonymized survey of 108 nba players bythe athleticin 2023, he was voted the worst referee in the nba. 4. he has had an ongoing feud with point guard chris paul, and the w-l statistics in games foster has officiated with pail on the court are remarkable (paul has a3-17 playoff record when foster is the referee, including 13 straight losses) ! after paul went public about the situation, the league held a meeting with them and commissioner adam silver made the following comments: ""you have there two veterans who are the best at what they do,scott is one of the highest-rated nba officials, which is why he referees in our finals games, and of course chris, the track record speaks for itself. the way you handle that is at least the way we've tried to handle that is to talk to both and say that the expectation is that you are going to be professionals and deal privately with the two of them and just say 'whatever the bad blood is between you two, you dont have to be friends but you both have to go out and do your jobs."" is this a tell as far as the likely winner of tonight's game? please post your thoughts on him below.",nba

"tatum is not a top 5 player if the playoffs are considered (stats included)here are the number of games below 20 points that tatum, and other stars he gets compared to have performed in the playoffs: https:www.basketball-reference.complayersttatumja01gamelog-playoffs(https:www.basketball-reference.complayersttatumja01gamelog-playoffs) tatum: 37119 playoff games luka: 555 playoff games giannis: 1884 playoff games jokic: 1389 playoff games steph: 32155 playoff games lebron: 31292 playoff games kd: 14170 playoff games harden: 73173 playoff games other than james harden, who is notoriously known to be an all time playoff dropper and choker, tatum has the worst percentage of playoff games scoring under 20 points (31 of his total games). 42 of tatum's 119 playoff games are at 40 from the field or worse. this may be the worst stat of them all: tatum has 75 (!!!) games of his 119 in the playoffs where he has shot 33 from 3 or worse. he only has 44 games shooting above 33 from 3. this is a career 37 shooter in the regular season. we all know tatum has made strides in his playmaking over the regular season (and usually increases his assists during the playoffs). but his efficiency has been falling off a cliff. even in the regular season, he shot fucking 34 from 3. we can talk about his defensive versatility as much as we want (he's been awful against the knicks on that end too), and he is good rebounder, but god damn this is the 3rd playoff run in a row since the 2022 finals where tatum's offense has fallen off a cliff, and he cannot be depended upon to score consistently. for comparison to contemporary stars - jalen brunson had a bad game 2 (still clinched the game with fts), but i fully expect him to score 20 in game 3, similar to how he did in game 1. he had fucking ausar thompson breathing down his neck all of the pistons series and still averaged 31.5 and 8. i respect brunson so much, dude is 6 feet tall and even in games where his shot isn't falling, i have complete faith he will make the right plays in the 4th quarter. his offensive process is much smarter too, he will attack the paint and get 10-12 foot jumpers and floaters to help even out his scoring. haliburton has been clutch, shooting well and winning games against good teams. donovan mitchell almost dropped 50 in game 2 and would've won the game if hali wasn't so clutch at the end. steph is like fucking 35 and getting hounded by amen thompson and an elite houston defense and found ways to score and play well. kawhi damn near lost his knee and was damn good and consistent throughout the nuggets series. the only other star who isn't shooting well right now is ant, and in his defense he is a few years younger than tatum and also he shot 40 from 3 leading the league in 3's this past season - something tatum has never done. and i'd argue ant is playing much better defense currently than tatum in the playoffs. tatum has zero go-to moves. that side-step 3 is abysmal, and he doesn't have consistent aggression in driving to the basket, and sometimes his finishing is horrible. if he's not having a 4-9 from 3pt game, then he's most likely not going to hit 20 or 25 points. he hasn't been passing at some elite level to compensate either. yes, he played well against the 7 seed injured magic, but this knicks series is what really matters. i just don't know if tatum has it in him to score efficiently against good defenders. he's good at multiple different things, but he is not great at any individual thing. you can say he has ""no weaknesses,"" but clearly if anyone has watched the last 2 games, his weaknesses jump off the screen. if tatum doesn't become a dependable scorer from 2pt range (something that every elite playoff player can do - jokic, steph, kawhi, kd, bron, even giannis), he will always be a low-floor high-ceiling player. and he hasn't honestly had any high-ceiling performances in a while. whoever got into tatum's head the last few years and told him that the only way to play basketball is from driveskicks and 3's needs to be under investigation. it has destroyed tatum's offensive versatility and made his game way too dependent on 3'slayups in a weird analytics way. calling him top 5 feels wrong too, considering jokicgiannissgaluka are all guys who don't go full quarters without being able to buy a bucket. and if you look at the second half of the top 10, guys like brunson, donovan, steph, bron, kd, ant, etc are all guys who don't have multiple duds in a row either. the consistency is what matters, and tatum doesn't have that yet. edit: since people wanted more context, here's some updated stats: tatum since 2020 playoffs (ignoring the first two years when he was more of a role player) 2187 games under 20 points. regular season vs. playoff true shooting: 2019-20 rs: 56.7 (23.4ppg) playoffs: 56.3 (25.7ppg) 2020-21 rs: 57.6 (26.4ppg) ts playoffs: 57.7 (30.6ppg) (this is when it started getting worse) 2021-22 rs: 57.8 (26.9ppg) playoffs: 56.2 (25.6 ppg) 2022-23 rs: 60.7 (30.1 ppg) playoffs: 58.5 (27.2 ppg) 2023-24 rs: 60.4 (26.9ppg) playoffs: 54.9 (25ppg) 2024-25 rs: 58.2 (26.8 ppg) playoffs: 54 (26.8ppg) the drop off in regular season to playoff efficiency keeps getting worse and worse. and post-2021, which is the last season when people truly trusted tatum's 3pt and midrange scoring consistently, he has been scoring less at worse efficiency.",nba

"what's your favorite proposal to strengthen home-court advantage in the playoffs (and thus make the regular season matter more)?yesterday, we highlighted the fact that home-court advantage(https:old.reddit.comrnbacomments1kh1nskroadteamsare50inroundtwosofarandthat) has been steadily on the decline in the nba (for reasons described in that post). we've seen that illustrated in the second round -- where road teams have gone 6-1 so far -- but also over a larger sample size over the last decade. these playoffs have been a lot of fun so it's hard to complain about them, but it's fair to wonder if the league should consider strengthening seeding and home-court advantage in some way. after all, the nba already has a problem with teams coasting through the regular season -- and that could get worse if teams cared about home-court even less than they do now. there have been a few proposals floated around, but i'll save my favorite for last. --- proposal 1: allowing top seeds to pick their opponent the idea that the top seed can pick any conference opponent they want has been championed by several pundits including kevin o'connor from yahoo. surely, that would be a slight extra advantage for the top seeds. they can pick a team suffering from injuries -- or a team that they feel like they match up well against. there's also the fun and narrative factor at play when an opponent gets ""called out."" the reason that i do not love this idea though is the unintended consequences. even if you protect the top 4 seeds (from being called out), you essentially make the difference between the seeds 5, 6, 7, and 8 irrelevant. if our goal is to make seeding matter more, then it should apply across the board and not just at the top. --- proposal 2: adding extra home games for higher seeds right now, the top seed has home-court advantage -- but really only in game 7, which amounts to 57 of the series in total. and based on historical data, we only see that decisive game 7 in about 25(https:www.nbcsportsboston.comnbanba-playoffs-game-7-history-statistics609963::textpostseason20history20says20the20finals,3820game207s20(28.825) of all playoff series anyway. it's not as strong of an edge as it is for sports like football. if want to strengthen the advantage of a top seed, we could go the most extreme and give them home-court advantage for the entire series. that'd certainly make the seeding matter, huh? but surely, we may be going too far there. fans (and ticket-hungry owners) of the lower seeded teams may riot. a potential compromise would be to give the top seed the home-court for 57 games -- 71 of the time. the top seed's schedule would look like this: game 1: home game 2: home game 3: away game 4: home game 5: home game 6: away game 7: home personally, i'd be willing to debate this change, but it's probably too extreme for traditional fans. moreover, it may be too extreme of an edge -- particularly in certain cases. even if you advocate for this system, you may want to make exceptions for the 45 matchup or for the finals. sports is supposed to be a true meritocracy, so we don't want home-court advantage to be too hard to overcome. so how do we strengthen home-court without sacrificing much in terms of history or game flow? --- proposal 3: giving the home team the ball to start quarters 2-3-4 finally, we arrive on my favorite proposal. for the playoffs, the home team starts each quarter (after the first) with possession. what does that mean exactly? let's take a step back. in basketball, we have an opening tip-off that's basically ceremonial. whoever loses the tip-off gets possession to start the next quarter, and the teams rotate. as a result, you get possession at the start of the quarter 2 out of 4 times. perfectly even. but if we want seeding to matter more, we can't make it ""even."" we have to try and increase the benefit of home-court advantage in small ways. in this proposed scenario, we'd keep the opening tip-off (which will now actually matter), and then after that, give the home team the possession to start quarter 2, quarter 3, quarter 4. instead of starting with possession in 2 (of 4) quarters it may be 3 or 4. i imagine most nba fans wouldn't even notice the difference. it wouldn't affect the flow of the game. but statistically, it would be meaningful. that extra 1 or 2 possessions would project as an extra 1 or 2 points per game. it'd give the home team more of a baked-in edge. it'd make having home-court matter more. and consequently, it'd make the regular season matter more.",nba

"oklahoma city's historic defense is a machine.when it comes to technology, apple is the standard. whether its a computer or an iphone, they dominate the space. their products are elegantly designed and highly functionalsleek with a kickass ios. few defenses in nba history have possessed elite-level hardware and software, and this oklahoma city team has both! strength. length. speed: all the athletic components needed. processing speed: their individual and collective intelligence. oklahoma city is one of the most intelligent basketball teams in the modern era. rarely do you see them blow a coverage or miss a rotation; their attention to detail in kyp is unmatched. kyp stands for know your personnel: it's an ifthen thought process combining an offensive scouting report and defensive coverages. if you understand a player's strengths, weaknesses, and tendencies. then you can apply the best defensive techniques to combat them. here's a basic example: malik beasley is a better shooter than he is a playmaker, so if there is a closeout situation with him, then the defender should sprint to run him off the line, turning him from a three-point shooter to a driver. the better the offensive player, the more extensive the kyp thought process can get. for all-nba-level players, the techniques and schemes needed to have a chance at not being embarrassed by them require all five defenders to be on the same page. primary defenders have the undesirable job of attempting to force these elite players away from their strengths and towards whatever hint of a weakness exists. at the same time, the other four defenders must know precisely what the primary defender is attempting to do, so they can be in the proper spots to provide immediate help or rotate to help the helper. oklahoma city excels in these situations against the nba elites; all five defenders consistently understand their kyp assignments and execute them flawlessly. athletic outliers: raw tools such as strength, length, and speed are prerequisites for elite defensive players. between holmgren, hartenstein, dort, williams, and gilgious-alexander, priest has assembled one of the league's biggest and longest starting fives in the league boasting a collective wingspan of thirty-five and a half feet. thats an average of over seven feet per player. and that group utilizes all that length to its advantage, generating six steals and five and a half blocks per game. those 12 opportunities are rocket fuel for their transition offense, creating moments where their collective speed can turn defense into easy baskets. if that starting five wasnt scary enough, oklahoma city also has a plethora of chaos agents they can bring in off the bench; wallace, joe, and caruso possess the elite quickness needed to smother ball handlers and get into the passing lanes. this team is built to get its hands on everything! this season, oklahoma city generated more deflections and forced more turnovers than any other team in the league. they also scored more points off those turnovers than any other team in the league, turning their defense into an accelerant to ignite their transition offense. and during their first round sweep of memphis, it was more of the same: oklahoma city forced 72 turnovers and scored 54 points off them. no player embodies this team's defensive intensity quite like alex caruso. this season, he averaged a deflection every five and a half minutes, one of the top rates in the league. and so far in the playoffs, hes found another gear, increasing his deflection rate to one every 4 minutes. the guy is absolutely unhinged out there, yet somehow he does it all under control and intelligently. during the second half of oklahoma citys 29-point game three comeback, caruso recorded seven deflections, and memphis scored an utterly anemic 13 points during his 13-second half minutes. the most difficult action to guard requires both: pick and roll actions have become the lifeblood of the nba game, and no action is run more. second spectrum categorizes the four core actions of a basketball game as pick-and-roll, handoff, isolation, and post-up. over 158,145 pnrs were run during this season, and the other three core actions were run for a combined 109,739 times. okc was the best team in the nba this season at guarding the pnr. almost every other guard on the oklahoma city roster can occasionally blow up a pick-and-roll. however, exceptional pick-and-roll defense requires all five players to do three things in quick succession: 1. see the same picture. (quickly--remember, ""do your work early.) 2. communicate. (clearly--he who talks first controls the actions.) 3. react (with force--time to put all the athleticism to work.) oklahoma city's pick-and-roll defense can check all three boxes: it's a potent mixture of intelligence, athleticism, and attention to detail. oklahoma city led the league in pick-and-roll defense, giving up a staggering 94 points for every 100 pick-and-rolls defended. it's a remarkable number when you consider the best pick-and-roll players in the league would score between 115 and 120 points with those same 100 opportunities. you cant just flip the defensive switch in the playoffs, especially in regards to defending the pick-and-roll; every team must build its rolodex of habits throughout the 82-game season. that way, when the playoffs come around and everything is faster and more intense, those habits are so ingrained that they turn into instincts. if you stop to think, where do i go? what's my next rotation? the offense wins, and your season is over. it's pretty simple. they consistently do the work early each possession to give themselves the best chance at success. oklahoma city's habits are as sharp as they come, making their instincts as quick as lightning. they have an extensive rolodex, or as the kids would say, a deep bag, that they can get to in terms of coverages: 9th in drop (40.4) 14th in switch (24.75) 18th in blitz (3.2) contrast that with teams that have limited pnr defensive profiles and how it leaves them susceptible in bad playoff matchups (edwards vs. lakers): lakers 1st in switch (39) and last in blitz (0.96) brooklyn 1st in blitz (14) and last in drop (20.7) oklahoma citys deep bag allows them to cover a wide variety of opponents, and they perform all the coverages at an elite level. theyre a daily fantasy player with a high floor and ceiling, the perfect combination. oklahoma city didnt invent a new defense; there's no proverbial smoking gun herejust simple coverages executed at lightning-fast speeds by some of the best athletes in the world. is it possible to score on them? sure, it's possible, but it's certainly not easy. it takes one of two things: a special effort of individual shot-making efforts: the level of shot-making and individual skill it takes to beat this team does exist. but to beat this team four times would take a historical effort of individual brilliance. offensive compounding: no defense can take away everything, although oklahoma city's defense sometimes makes me question that statement. if an offensive team can string together enough tiny wins within any given possession, they can find their way into semi-open to open shots. however, as oklahoma city gets into the later rounds of the playoffs, some teams can bring both elements to the table, as doncic and dallas did last season. denver, minnesota, golden state, and boston all fit the bill. superstars like jokic, edwards, curry, and tatum are all capable of the individual brilliance needed, and if they get enough help from their teammates, who knows?",nba

"the celtics are the fourth team in nba history to attempt more 3s than 2s in a season, and by far the most extreme. the 2024-25 celtics shoot 3s at a 15.3 higher clip than 2s, eclipsing the 2018-19 rockets by more than 7i see many mentions of the celtics atrocious recent shooting woes, but i have not seen many comparisons of their style to other recent nba teams and how they are a extreme outlier in terms of 3pt shot attempts. according to my basketball reference research the 2024-25 celtics are only the fourth team with more 3pa than 2pa in a season. i am calling this their shot preference. i believe teams with higher 3pt shot preference are doomed to underachieve in the playoffs. the only other teams to ever do this over regular seasons was the rockets from 2017-2020, and we all know how it ended for them in the playoffs. : 2017-18 rockets: 0.9 3pt shot preference (42.3 3pag vs 41.9 2pag) 2018-19 rockets: 8.0 3pt shot preference (45.4 3pag vs 42.0 2pag) 2019-20 rockets: 0.2 3pt shot preference (45.3 3pag vs 45.2 2pag) 2024-25 celtics: 15.0 3pt shot preference (48.2 3pag vs 41.8 2pag) players on teams with higher 3pt preference tend float to open space behind the 3pt line instead of cut to space near the basket, because that is what coaches and practice have conditioned them to do. while this proved effective for the celtics last year, this season they have taken it to the extreme. last year they had a 2pt preference of 12, much lower than the league average 2pt preference of 36. as the title states, this season they now have a 3pt preference of 15.3 the highest of any team in nba history. the more physically and mentally exhausting nature of the playoffs affects some player's focus and flow and inhibits their ability to hit long shots. 3s require touch, focus and finesse not needed to put your head down and drive to the hole for a layup. i think the extra strain of the playoffs combined with the 3pt shot preference is a recipe for bad playoff performances.",nba

""my whole career, on and off the court, has been about stepping up decisively in the moments that matter most,"" westbrook wrote in a statement to cnbc. westbrook and the nuggets are currently facing the oklahoma city thunder in the nba western conference semifinals. ""eazewell is exactly that a decisive solution to a very real problem."" the los angeles-based company uses ai to curate funeral options catered to each user's budgets and preferences. the platform assists with paperwork, budget planning, invitations and overlooked tasks such as canceling a deceased loved one's utility bills and social media accounts. eazewell currently has 11 employees and has already tested its beta platform with more than 1,000 families. eazewell has not disclosed funding but has revenue agreements with partner services. the startup is also working on partnerships with finance and life insurance companies in the space. the service is free to use and does not have an ads component ""at this stage,"" a company spokesperson said. ""we're trying to take the weight off people's shoulders as much as we can, and make this process so much easier for people,"" walker told cnbc in a phone interview. walker played college basketball with beverly at the university of connecticut. eazewell traces its origins to westbrook and beverly's high school days, when their friend and basketball teammate khelcey barrs iii passed away unexpectedly from an enlarged heart. westbrook commemorates barrs to this day by wearing a bracelet with the initials ""kb3"" in every nba game he plays and on his signature jordan why not zer0.6 ""khelcey barrs"" shoe. ""it's a reminder that life can change in an instant,"" westbrook said. ""you don't get to choose the moment, but you do get to choose how you respond."" the experience left a lasting effect on the two friends, beverly said, but it wasn't until the death of beverly's parents that he experienced funeral planning hurdles firsthand. beverly said the experience was ""messy"" and ""grueling."" disillusioned and frustrated by the process after the death of his mother and father in 2016 and 2023, respectively, beverly turned to his close friends to come up with the solution that became eazewell. ""it just seems like the perfect time to really turn our shared pain into purpose,"" beverly said. one of eazewell's most innovative features is its voice-activated ai agent that can gather cost quotes and call funeral homes on a user's behalf. recent advancements in ai have only recently made it possible to automate tasks and create agents that can manage these jobs in an empathetic and compassionate manner, said viviane ghaderi, eazewell's tech chief and a former amazon executive. stephen stokols, an eazewell investor and ceo of tru skye ventures, an early-stage sports technology and wellness venture firm, said these ""transformational"" ai advancements helping bring the funeral industry out of the ""dark ages"" initially drew him to the project. walker said he hopes eazewell can offer users the tools to navigate a topic that is not taught in school or early life. ""we know how important it is to have someone by your side to help with the details that come after a loss,"" westbrook said. please dont let this be a scam that tarnishes kembas spotless reputation",nba

"knicks defense is being completely downplayedthroughout the first game, as well as after the game the narrative for this series vs. the celtics primarily was that they missed wide open or open threes and they just had an off shooting night. maybe from a tracking or analytics perspective that number makes sense, but if you watch the games itself, these are not open shots majority of the time. sure the celtics are also missing some wide open threes that you see on the tape when the defense collapses, but that is not the net variety of what we see. just because a shot is open does not mean it is not rushed due to a defender closing out from a hedge which we see a lot this series as the knicks have moved away from drop coverage into full switches with hard hedges from the wings. tracking data fails to account for if a shot is rushed, if it is a shot in motion of the offense, if its a step back 3 that gives space to make it a open shot but still a guy jumping at you. these are what a majority of the celtics actual looks are, so the knicks deserve more credit on defense, they have held up well. this was also apparent in the second game, their defense is great on ball on tatum and brown even the mismatches with brown, brunson made great contests for difficult looks. the knicks also at least in the second game, went down 20 largely due to swings that came from fouls. some stalled momentum such as the charge that derrick white took from og which would have cut the lead to 7 with an and 1, which was actually not a set charge his feet were moving and it swung momentum. i think the narrative is also very tiring that oh, the celtics just arent playing great but the knicks are playing their best basketball. it is such a garbage and lazy take that is being spread around the media as well as these subs. game 2, brunson had 16 points total and has shot 35 from the field, og had a stinker, and they actually had their worst offensive rating of any game this season. the knicks have a lot to improve on offensively as well, and brunson doesnt have two bad games in a row, it could look very difficult in msg tomorrow with the momentum going to new york. when will people start to give this knicks team credit for the defensive presence they are showing, its non stop pressure. i think knicks win this series ultimately in 6, the celtics will keep chucking this up to variance, and mazzulla will not change his analytics.",nba

"former dallas mayor: ""dallas fans deserve better than a billionaire owner more focused on lobbying for casino legislation than protecting the franchise.""""... and as a capper, harrison recently said publicly, i did know that luka was important to the fanbase, i didnt quite know to what level. really? thats not a credible thing for the gm of a major sports franchise to say. for me, having led this city, i think this comes down to the importance of engaged and committed local ownership in our sports franchises. what ive seen since patrick dumont and the adelson family took over the mavs suggests a lack of interest in the basketball operations and this community. from where i sit, the priority is clear: use this asset to further the familys casino business, dumont approved a trade that its hard to believe any local owner would have accepted; it gutted the teams identity and shattered a deep bond with its fans. it was apathy or a lack of understanding about luka and the dallas fan base that gave harrison the authority to carry out his trade plan regardless of the damage done. absenteeism has cost dallas dearly. hopefully, our public officials will remember this when the prospect of gambling is next raised. mark cuban, over his decades of ownership, brought a passion for basketball and commitment to our community. i can only wonder what his reaction is in hindsight to selling the team to out of town owners who havent reflected his commitment. there is no question it will affect his legacy. dallas fans deserve better than a front office more loyal to its industry contacts than its players. they deserve better than a billionaire owner more focused on lobbying for casino legislation than protecting the franchise. above all, they deserve accountability. fans invest their time, their money and their belief in these teams. that investment deserves reciprocation. when you are the steward of a sports franchise, you are a steward of public trust. this wasnt just a bad trade. it was a betrayal and a violation of that trust. it should be hard to earn back."" tom leppert https:www.dallasnews.comopinioncommentary20250509former-dallas-mayor-the-luka-trade-is-going-to-hurt-for-a-long-time",nba

"why does every nba analyst get fooled every year?every year, there's a regular-season juggernaut that gets overhyped by analysts. the team usually has great depth and racks up wins, but when the playoffs come around, that depth doesn't matter as much. rotations shrink to seven or eight guys, and the postseason becomes about star power, experience, and execution. that's when the overhyped team often gets exposed by a more battle-tested group led by an elite playoff performer. this is the pattern i see with teams like okc. not that they can't win but they're rarely as dominant in the playoffs as people expect based on their regular-season success. and somehow, we all forget this lesson every year and have to relearn it come may and june. teams like last years celtics dont fall into this category. they dominate the regular season and have playoff experience. they're built for both edit: you can also add the cavs to this rant",nba

"yoav modai jalen brunson's mother, sandra: ""i never dared to dream that my son would become the king of new york""yoav modai is an israeli journalist who works for sport5 (israeli sports media) and currently lives in new york (he is also a knicks fan), and he is one of 100 journalist to vote for the nba regular season awards. i've decided to translate this article (by myself), from hebrew to english, by myself, for mother's day. the article (in hebrew) - via sport5(https:nba.sport5.co.ilarticles.aspx?folderid403&docid505727) title: ""i never dared to dream that my son would become the king of new york"" description: ""on mother's day in the usa, jalen brunson's mother shares an exclusive interview with the sport's channel."" (that's also another name for sport5) the article: gt;after the new york knicks' loss to boston in game 3 last night (saturday) and before game 4 between monday and tuesday, the big apples star jalen brunson has time to spend with his family and recharge himself with some new energies, which might help him lead his team to a stunning 3-1 lead. in honor of mothers day, celebrated today in the united states, brunsons mother, sandra, spoke with the sports channel about her bond with her son, her role in his success, and his dream. gt;it feels amazing to be the mom of an nba superstar; its a blessing. i know how hard jalen worked for this, how much he sacrificed, and its fun for me to see him living his dream, sandra says. at the same time, our relationship is very public, so i have to be careful when im cheering in the stands. gt;my role in jalens success? i always reminded him to stay humble, keep his feet on the ground after successes and failures, push his teammates, and never take anything for granted. i leave all the professional stuff to his dad. gt;today, jalen doesnt consult me before games, but i always tell him how proud i am of him. after losses, i send him an encouraging message, and after wins, we talk more. he just needs me in the role of mom. gt;brunson, as is well known, has become a superstar with the knicks, which means shining on the biggest stagenew york. sandra: i cant wrap my head around the fact that my son is the king of new york, especially as someone who grew up in new york. i hear people say it, and its not something i take for granted; its a huge compliment. gt;at the same time, i know jalen and the knicks have a lot of work ahead of them, so i try not to get too caught up in the frenzy. its really exciting for me to see all the fans in new york wearing his jersey, and as someone who grew up hereeven in my wildest dreams, i never imagined something like this. gt;sandra shared about jalens development as a basketball player: i believe mothers and parents in general should let their kids lead them, not the other way around. i let my kids choose their sport during childhood, but it was important to me and rick that they grow up with some kind of sport, because theres no substitute for the qualities you develop as a young athlete, especially in a team sport. gt;i know its tough to support your kids after work hours and that some sports and activities cost a lot of money, but my advice to parents is that if your child really wants to play a sport, go with it and help them grow as they get older, because it can lead to so much more. i volunteered for jalen. gt;what do i wish for myself on mothers day? to be with my family, with my granddaughter (jalens daughter), and i want everyone to smile and enjoy being together, she concluded. gt;",nba

"is it possible to have 30 points on 61 shooting, 6 rebounds, with 2 blocks and not have a great game?i believe kuminga had one of the most interesting games, and the ensuing discourse about his performance highlights the disparity in how different fan segments evaluate a players performance. if we solely rely on the stat sheet, which many fans consider the sole indicator of a great game, the notion of kumingas performance being lackluster seems absurd. he scored numerous points without taking many shots, and his contributions ignited an offensive spark for a team that desperately needed it during game 2 and especially game 3. kuminga had 30,6, and 2 blocks on 61 shooting in 36 minutes. at the same time, kuminga had a crucial stretch towards the end of the game where he contributed to the wolves being able to seal the victory. kuminga made the opposite of winning plays. a slew of terrible decisions by kuminga transpired. the decision to shoot contested shots over traffic instead of passing the ball, fell right into what the wolves wanted late in the game. kuminga took a 9-foot turnaround fadeaway at 3:02 and an 11-foot floater at 2:16, points where the warriors needed a basket. despite his scoring, kuminga essentially took the game into a 2 v 5 and focused significantly more on just getting his points even at the detriment of being a black hole more so than balancing that with occasionally creating opportunities for teammates other than jimmy, essentially disrupting any possibility of trying to engineer an offensive flow. kuminga needed a big offensive game and needed to score a lot just for the warriors to have a chance, i dont contest that but, there were several times he couldve contributed to an extra pass and get his teammates involved. onto the numerous defensive lapses. it is not a secret that defense has been an area for kuminga to improve since he entered the league. jonathan has incredible potential but, i also think thats what makes it so frustrating is how atrocious his effort can be and how sometimes he genuinely looks lost as to what his defensive assignments are. towards the end of the third, and the top of the 4th, warriors had a chance to extend their lead but kuminga allows a routine blow by, for whatever reason, allowing ant to go inside to the paint with no resistance for an easy basket. kuminga then gets blown by by divencenzo to the bucket which leads to the team crashing the paint to stop the layup which leads to kick outs eventually to an edwards 3. the bucket at the 7:10 mark just after the warriors lead 82-77 will get pinned on draymond for going for the steal but kuminga is also super late rotate over and react and knowing your personnel should tell julius is not kicking it out to the corner and even if he does, jimmy rotates to mcdaniels. theres a lot of little defensive intricacies and nuances which matter so much in a tight playoff game and you dont have to be perfect but these lapses are sometimes the differences between wins and losses. while kumingas stat line paints the picture of a breakout performance, the full context tells a more complicated story. his offensive surge helped spark momentum, but his decision-making down the stretch and persistent defensive lapses undermined that impact when it mattered most. evaluating a great game should require more than just efficiency and counting stats. not saying it shouldnt be factored at all but there might be more to it than for that to just be the end all be all. its just interesting because theres a lot of players who have an inefficient scoring output and the score box isnt the sexiest but they make all the little plays and contribute to their team winning but a large sector of fans will say they had a bad game.",nba

"draft lottery is tomorrow: here are the predetermined ""fixes"" for each teamwith the draft lottery tomorrow, the fans of teams who didn't make the post-season have their favourite year-end event: the draft lottery every time the draft lottery is held, we begin to hear suggestions that it was fixedrigged, with proof! what proof will there be this year? below are all potential proofs lottery conspiracy theorists may come up with for why flagg was always destined to go to the lottery winners. utah jazz: white. washington wizards - on october 21st, 2024 wizards owner ted leonsis suddenly announced he had entered an agreement to keep the wizards in dc, ending chatter about a move to virginia. agreement promised a new stadium renovation, and that the team could not consider relocation until 2045. why the sudden change from leonsis? he must've been promised the rights to cooper flagg of course. not to mention someone named flagg playing for the nation's capital? too obvious. charlotte hornets: lamelo is one of the most popular young players in the league, leading the east backcourt in all-star votes. play seems rather obvious here. pair him with flagg and you've given gen z its team. plus, the hornets were sold in summer 2023. new ownership didnt care about the shitty 2024 draft though, so the league mustve promised them the 1 pick in 2025 of course. new orleans pelicans: we saw how much attention the pelicans and zion got when he was a rookie. he needs a partner in crime. who better than another 'generational' duke prospect in flagg? philadelphia 76ers: philly is a massive market, with one of the most talked-about superstars in the league in joel embiid. the franchise is on life support right now, and the nba doesn't want to lose out - giving them flagg would fix this. brooklyn nets: the nets reside in the biggest market in the league, yet they haven't quite shed the knicks' little brother label. giving them flagg could change things. toronto raptors: with the lottery being rigged every year, the nba needs to throw in curveballs here and there to throw fans off the scent. cant rig it every year, itd be too obvious. give flagg to the raptors to accomplish this. san antonio spurs: the league wants wemby to be the face of the league, and he cant be the face of the league with a middling roster. give him another stud to pair with fox and let the ratings flow in. houston rockets (phx unprotected pick): houston is a huge market on the brink of a dynasty. we just saw how great they performed in the playoffs. adding flagg to that high-flying (and sengun) core is guaranteed ratings, and also ensures a great environment for flagg to grow and develop into the modern american superstar the nba needs. combine that with the built-in china market from yao, and a successful franchise in houston would only be a positive for the league. portland trail blazers: portland refused to tank this year, going on a meaningless run at the end of the season. nba wants to send a message to the likes of utah and washington that tanking wont help, so they give flagg to portland. dallas mavericks: self explanatory. we all know whats going on here chicago bulls: chicago is an absolutely massive market thats been struggling. the nba is simply a better place when chicago is good. easy decision to send flagg here sacramento kings: the kings just months ago sent their franchise player, deaaron fox, to the spurs to play with wemby, and received a pittance in return. why would they do that??? well with wemby being the next face of the league, the nba desperately needed a star next to him. after being promised flagg, the kings acquiesced and gave fox for next to nothing, because flagg was the real prize.. atlanta hawks: 1 overall pick back to back years? psh, yeah, right. obviously rigged, just like the cavs in 2013 and 2014 was rigged too.",nba

"inexpensive da pistol recommendationsi'm looking for a gun primarily to use for dry fire practice. i've been doing dry fire practice pretty regularly with my good pistols, but they are all sao so breaking my grip every time to rack the slide back is getting annoying. and, my pistols all have great triggers so i'm training on easy mode. i've been considering buying a th 9 to essentially only use for dry fire practice. i mean, thousands of dollars get spent on ammo and guns; a 300 pistol just for practice sounds like an almost financially-sound thing to do. i want a rail mount for my mantis x and a heavy, long, undesirable trigger pull preferably in a full or medium frame size. is the th 9 a good fit in these regards? any other ideas?",guns

"what is a mini-acog mount? are there a lot of optic options with said mount?i'm new to firearms so apologies if my question is obtuse. what exactly is a mini-acog mount? from what i can tell, it's the interface connection between the optic and the optic mount which then connects to the actual firearm, most commonly via picatinny rail. is there a large market of optics that have mini-acog mounts? i'm planning on getting my first rifle soon, a mini-14, and came across this stripper clip guide 3x microprism mount from cogburn arsenal(https:cogburnarsenal.comproductmini-14-30-3x-microprism-mount-582-or-higher). i love the idea of having the option to reload via stripper clips like an old bolt action or sks so i'm pretty dead set on getting it. the issue is that the description says that it uses a mini-acog mount, but is designed exclusively to work with the pa 3x microprism. but if the scope mounts via mini-acog, wouldn't any scope that has mini-acog mounts be able to mount to it? i know that the people that would know the most are the folks at cogburn, and i sent them an email but they've yet to reply.",guns

"range usa - first time back in 3years. . . .this is gonna be a book. tldr this place is horrible. stopped going a few years ago when they wanted either 75 or 100 for a transfer (forget the exact number but it was stupid regardless). use a local fll for that now & any fun smithing- good dudes. started shooting at outdoor ranges after that. figured its their business they want to run their way- i just made the choice i wasnt going out of my way to give them more business didnt seem community friendly. ive been craving a new carry gun and i went to shoot some side by side i should have trusted my spidey senses but i had time to kill. first i went to the kiosk to fill out a waiver (signage saying you need one every year). while im filling it out i was chit chatting the clerk at the rental booth asking if they had any vp9ks or shadow 2 compacts available to rent. he asked me if the vp9 was the glock thing- i told him hk and he immediately said no. i got up to the counter to see what was available- its 90 sig, glock, and springfield only thing i was semi interested in comparing against those two was a pdp compact so i asked for that. the clerk put his hand on top of a sticker they have on the glass while shaking his head- it says something like first time guests are not allowed to rent guns. i said something to the extent of i used to shoot here every week for a few years, this is just my first waiver in over a year he seemed skeptical and said yeah i understand buuu or something like that, but then i told him i shoot idpa and i promise i wont cause a headache- so i was able to slip passed that gate keeper. i asked if i could swap out whatever i was shooting back at the rental booth. he proudly said nope, that requires a membership! so aside from paying for range time, targets and ammo at all inflated prices( plus some shake down first time in a year fee), i had to pay 20 per gun for any gun i wanted to shoot. the total rang up to 140. i almost walked out i intended to come buy 4 boxes of ammo and shoot 2-4 guns that i may turn around and buy afterwards. already planned a trip with the wife, dropped her off shopping and this was my thing to kill time with so against my better judgement i said fuck it and checked out, regretting it not long after. not even ragging on 2x ros standing behind me the whole time, i understand they cater to the general public and what that means. imo, range usa is only interested inshort term profits. why would gun guys ever want to go there? im a capitalist, so im not saying making money is bad or they shouldnt make a ton of money- they should. that said, my previous avoidance of range usa turned into an actual boycott. done and telling everyone in the area i live that shoots how horrible a value it is. not interested in business that nickel and dime. shitty rental selection too. anyways. rant over. had to bitch to the ether. edit: only bought 2 boxes of ammo wasnt gonna spend an additional 20 gun after i shot the pdp and didnt see anything else not springfield, glock or sig lol.",guns

"which cartridge should i go with for my scout like rifle?hi i'm trying to decide which cartridge to go with for a scout like rifle that i'm building off of a mauser 98 action. the top cartridges that i'm considering are 8x57 mm is mauser, 7x57 mm mauser, and .308 winchester. the 8mm is mauser strong points: should have minimum losses out of a 18"" (457.2mm) length barrel due to the usage of faster burning powders, the receivers feed lips are already machined for it, surplus ammunition is still available, and i don't have one. weak points: not the most abundant abundant ammo and reloading components, minimum muzzle threads are m15x1 mm with 58""-24 tpi or m16x1 mm being better, harder to find muzzle devices (ie flash hiders, muzzle brakes and sound suppressors) must be .338"" (8.6 mm) or bigger, surplus ammunition has croosive primers, berdan primed, and might need a powder swap. 7x57 mm mauser's strong points: 7mm bullets are easier to find, is somewhat more popular, can use 916""-24 tpi muzzle threads, can use .30 cal muzzle devices. weak points: loaded ammunition isn't the cheapest, brass isn't the most common, most 7mm bullets are optimized for faster cartridges, slower burning powders requires a longer barrel especially with the lower pressures when compared to newer cartridges, i already have one a 93 mauser. .308 winchester's strong points: it's currently one of the most abundant cartridges out there in terms of factory ammo and reloading components, makes the rifle a true scout. muzzle devices are plentiful. weak points: wasted cartridge overall length .308 maximum col 2.815""(71.5 mm) vs 7x57 mm mausers 3.065"" (77.85 mm) and 8x57 is mausers 3.25"" (82.55 mm) which ,in order is a loss of 0.435""(11.05 mm) , 0.185""(4.7 mm), which requires a magazine spacer, i already have one, remington 788. there are other cartridges but they have their own issues, 30-06 (feed lip, feed ramp and magazine modification, longer barrer, already have in a 1903 springfield), 6.5 mm creedmore(slow powders, .308 winchester spacer), .257 roberts p and 6mm remington (scarcity, max cartridge length is knee capped to fit short actions). so which cartridge should i go with?",guns

(https:i.imgur.comt9b5jud.jpg) the zero stop(https:i.imgur.comjynivox.jpg) and cap switching mechanism is super cool and easy to use, with nice seals. the illum battery cap is the kind where you keep turning past the end of adjustment to loosen. feels sketchy the first time you do it, but it is fine. glass here's the important part. the glass is shockingly similar to the mk4mk5hd line of optics, but with less ca and i believe better color and contrast by a bit. resolution tested to be pretty simlar to the optika6. it does have more ca than optics that i tend to be attracted to - and i would consider this to be a mild-medium ed glass optic. xtr pro test target(https:i.imgur.combx1fuy2.jpg) optika6 test target(https:i.imgur.comwrmgbxo.jpg) razor iii test target(https:i.imgur.comsjbqetd.jpg) you can plainly see the difference there. here's an interesting one: razor iii anti reflective coatings(https:i.imgur.comzhhjn1g.jpg) razor iii light baffling(https:i.imgur.comzhhjn1g.jpg) xtr pro anti reflective coatings(https:i.imgur.comhui7rfq.jpg) xtr pro light baffling(https:i.imgur.comhqxvvbs.jpg) i think there's a couple points to observe here. one - classic blue vs green anti-reflective coating choice. typically, more expensive coatings are tuned towards blue. the razor has a brighter reflection on the objective, indicating its anti-reflective coatings are not as performant. as such, the xtr pro glass looks more transparent. that's good. also to note, the light baffling is much more visible in the xtr pro. this is good - means more light is getting through the glass. the downside is that the light baffling has to work harder to cut down glare. the point of the light baffles is that light coming in hitting the edges of the scope aren't reflecting down the scope tube toward your eye. ideally, they would absorb the light and convert to heat as this would prevent the reflection off the baffling from striking the objective and getting back to your eye. near fielddof test(https:i.imgur.comqohujw2.jpg) lower magnification environment shot(https:i.imgur.comy5p5foi.jpg) - image presentation is excellent, eyeguides are okay, reticle has vanished. max magnification(https:i.imgur.comuspggno.jpg) on limbs. the reticle is still very fine and difficult to pick up without illum on. the mk5 had the same issue - but unlike the mk5, this optic has illum available at a lower price point. riii on tree trunk and sun(https:i.imgur.comjbs4vkt.jpg) o6 on the same target(https:i.imgur.comigxi0dk.jpg) xtr pro on the same target(https:i.imgur.commnx8lgc.jpg) resolution is a tier. colorcontrast is a tier. ca performance is b tier. illumination illum is good(https:i.imgur.comvcr2xin.jpg). bright at the bright, dual colors. a little bleed on the numbers, but not too bad. here's a cool shot on how dual illum works. zoomed out at at high brightness on a dark background, you can see the projectors. here is red(https:i.imgur.comk4bqqbq.jpg) and here is green(https:i.imgur.comzofrgmt.jpg). i really want to turn both on at once and make yellow. that'd be sick. conclusion this optic has many strong points. it does everything the mk5hd does without the stupid turrets or features or markings, but also made in usa and at the same weight. it comes standard with things the mk5hd should have but didn't. it comes in a magnification range that the mk5hd should have but didn't. if you were looking for a leupy mk5hd based on its weight specs, and aren't getting it more than half off because of some cert or deal, then this is what you should be buying. what else? but how does it stand on its own? well - the glass is what you would expect at the price point. it doesn't punch up, it doesn't punch down. the features are better than what you would expect at its price point - feature rich and capable. i would consider it more of a benchmark buy than a value buy. that is why this review seems a bit... dry and clinical. i don't have any really strong opinions about it because it is... what you would expect from it. if you want the features, which are competition oriented and make the scope flexible in role, buy it. if you want really high quality lr targetgamer scope, save up a little more and try to catch a razor iii on-sale, which has better glass, charismatic turrets, and looks like it costs what it does. and whatever you do, stay away from the red trim version of the burris xtr pro.",guns

"cz scorpion, mpx k, or now springfield kuna?im wanting to add a 9mm sub gun to my collection. ive been on the search for a cz scorpion, only could find a used micro for 999 locally. switched to looking for a mpx k and can only find copperheads locally. just watched a couple videos on the springfield kuna and on paper it seems like a great option. how is everyone feeling about it? i could probably end up getting one and a suppressor for about the cost of a mpx k. local dealer said about 1800 for the mpx k once he can find one. looked at a ruger pc charger and just did not love it. looked at a cmmg banshee and loved the size and feel but ive heard mixed reviews on reliability. most of the draw to the mpx is brand stigma and it being a well established platform.",guns
"settled on a 5.56 setup after falling down the barrel length & ammo rabbit holelately ive been trying to figure out what the ideal 5.56 setup looks like for home defense and general-purpose usesomething that could handle cqb distances but still be effective out to a couple hundred yards if needed. im not military or le, just a civilian who enjoys shooting and wanted to understand how barrel length and ammo choice actually affect terminal performance. the first thing i ran into was velocity. 5.56 isnt a magic laser beamit relies heavily on fragmentation or expansion to do damage. most fmj loads need 2,500 fps to yaw or fragment properly. some expanding rounds (like bonded soft points or copper hollow points) can work below that threshold, but velocity still matters. barrel length vs velocity (approximate): velocities are approximatereal-world numbers vary based on gas system, ammo brand, weather, etc. heres what i found in terms of velocity loss from different barrels using common 62gr loads: ""	20 2,880 fps ""	16 2,800 fps ""	14.5 2,700 fps ""	13.7 2,650 fps ""	11.5 2,500 fps ""	10.3 2,400 fps that might not seem like much, but dropping below 2,500 fps can dramatically reduce fragmentation for fmjs. with rounds like m193, m855, and mk262, you lose reliable fragmentation past about 100150 yards on shorter barrels. they just zip through without doing much internal damage. thats where ammo choice comes in. if youre running a short barrel, you need a round that doesnt rely entirely on fragmentation. bonded soft points and solid copper hollow points fill that gap. they expand at lower velocities and still penetrate effectivelyeven through barriers. civilianle ammo that actually performs: ""	m193 (55gr fmj): cheap and fast from a 20 barrel, but it needs 3,100 fps to fragment reliably. loses effectiveness quickly from shorter barrels. ""	federal tbbc (62gr) this was developed for the fbi. its a bonded soft point that expands reliably through glass, drywall, and even car doors. it penetrates 1418 in gel and expands to about 0.5 even at 2,500 fps. ""	speer gold dot (64gr) very similar to tbbc. bonded jacket, consistent expansion, works great from short barrels. ""	barnes tsx (5570gr) copper solid. doesnt fragment, but expands wide and stays together. often used in jurisdictions that ban lead core ammo. if youre military or restricted to fmj, the best options seem to be: ""	mk318 mod 0 (62gr) made for short barrels. fragmenting front solid base means it works well at lower velocity and punches through barriers. ""	m855a1 (62gr epr) yaws and fragments better than legacy m855. works from 14.5 barrels and still gets decent effect past 300 yards. ""	mk262 mod 1 (77gr otm) great for soft targets at long range. fragmentation is violent, but you need 2,600 fps to get the full effect, so best from 16 barrels. edit: what really sold me on tbbc over other options was its performance window. unlike fmj or otm rounds that rely on fragmentation and need higher velocity to do real damage, tbbc is a bonded soft point that expands reliably down to about 2,200 fps. from a 14.5 barrel, it leaves the muzzle at around 2,700 fps, staying above that threshold out to roughly 250275 yards. that means you get consistent expansion across nearly all realistic engagement distances. by comparison, an 11.5 barrel launches it closer to 2,500 fps, and tbbc drops below its expansion floor somewhere around 100150 yards. so while shorter barrels are great for maneuverability, youre sacrificing terminal effectiveness the moment you stretch the range. the 14.5 setup preserves lethality while still keeping the rifle compact and fast-handling. so why 14.5? i originally assumed 10.311.5 would be ideal for maneuverability. but when you look at performance lossespecially velocity and effective range, its clear youre making big sacrifices: ""	14.5 barrels still get 2,700 fps with 62gr loads ""	that gives bonded rounds full expansion capability past 250 yards ""	youre only losing 2550 fps compared to a 16, but gaining a more compact rifle ""	if you pin and weld a muzzle device and youre legally past the 16 minimum without registering as an sbr compare that to an 11.5youre looking at 200 fps lost, which pushes bonded ammo close to its minimum velocity window and really limits range. accuracy from multiple tests (including snipershide and le sources), tbbc tends to shoot around 1.5 moa from quality setups. thats: ""	1.5 at 100 yards ""	4.5 at 300 yards easily enough to hit vital zones under pressure. optic choice i tried to figure out what would actually work across the 5300 yard range without being overkill. ""	vortex razor gen ii-e 16x very forgiving eye box, daylight-bright reticle, and extremely fast at 1x. weighs 21.5 oz. ""	nightforce nx8 18x lighter and more compact, but tighter eye relief and not quite as good optically at 1x. ""	razor gen iii 110x tempting, but overkill unless youre consistently shooting past 400 yards. heavier too. final setup that made the most sense: ""	14.5 barrel with a pinnedwelded muzzle device ""	federal tbbc or speer gold dot ""	razor hd gen ii-e 16x optic that setup keeps things compact, delivers full expansion and barrier performance, and still lets me reach out to 275300 yards with confidence. it took a while to dig through all the ballistics data and testing sources, but i came out of it feeling way more confident about what worksand why. ; tl;dr summary of what i found: ""	dropping below 14.5 starts to hurt your velocity enough to limit range and terminal performance ""	bonded soft points (like federal tbbc or speer gold dot) expand reliably through barrierseven from short barrels ""	m855a1 and mk318 are the best fmj-type rounds if youre stuck with hague-compliant ammo ""	14.5 barrels get 2,700 fps with 62gr loadsmore than enough for reliable expansion out to 250 yards ""	tbbc is accurate to 1.5 moa, good enough for consistent torso hits to 300 yards ""	vortex razor gen ii-e 16x is fast, bright, and ideal for a rifle used from 5300 yards ""	these are the same rounds used by fbi, socom, and a lot of le agencies, so real-world data backs them up ""	went way deeper than i meant to, but maybe it saves someone else the research spiral",guns

"springfield kuna my first pcchey guys, i've carried a springfield xds for about 6 years (hard to remember), and i've been a fan of the brand as a result - even when they were getting lots of hate for supporting the illinois dealer licensing act. well, i guess i'm a fan of hs produkt. my xds has never had a malfunction in 2-3k rounds of various fmj and hollow point ammo, and it seems the general consensus is that springfield's most reliable products aren't made by springfield. i don't practice with my ccw as much as i should, but it has been through a decent amount of testing and shown incredible reliability. i also dig the grip safety, unlike 95 of the gun community. i've wanted a pcc since cz dropped the scorpion evo 3 in 2015. the idea of a compact home defense weapon that wouldn't immediately blow my eardrums if fired indoors was incredibly attractive. cheap ammo means i get to practice more, and i love to shoot. i almost pulled the trigger the scorpion a few times, but small things kept me away. ""springfield just dropped a stribog... why didnt you just get the stribog?"" i thought it was ugly. yep. that's the whole reason. when i saw that springfield was dropping a fully ambi (iefty) roller-delayed pcc for under a grand, i knew i was going to buy one. i know the roller delay system isnt mp5 level, but simply not being direct blowback at this price point is impressive. not much competition here. i'm usually a late adopter of products, but it checked too many boxes for me, and i have a lot of trust in hs produkt. we will see if that trust was misplaced with time. i called my lgs today for shits and giggles, thinking there was no chance they would have one. i had 6 different online shops on ""notify me"", and figured one call couldn't hurt. turns out they got this kuna in last night. after i bought it, i heard a sales guy in the store say ""did someone buy the kuna already??"" think he was bummed and wanted to play with it some more. i had developed a relationship with the guys there when i was shooting 3 days a week at their range, so they took care of me on the price. not going to give full details, but let's just say i'm very happy, considering what many people are willing to pay right now. i'm looking forward to shooting the kuna and working on my pcc shooting abilities. i'd like to get my wife up to speed with the platform asap. it always bothered me that she would be trying to defend herself with a pistol if someone broke into our home. pistols are simply difficult to operate accurately for inexperienced shooters. i want her to be able to get shots on target. welp, that's enough rambling for me. just riding the high of new gun day. take care, guys.",guns

"question about red dot pistol zeroing.i am a newbie shooter with about 4000 rounds of practice on iron sight, half of those now shot with both eyes open. my marksmanship skills could use work, but i can consistently get good 5 round groups on 4 or more shots. i installed a holosun eps on my glock 19.5. i attempted to zero it at 15 yards with a shitty bench rest. it was a bit difficult, so i reduced the zeroing to 10 yards. i got a 2-3inch group at 10 yards. felt pretty janky using the bench rest and my inexperience with red dots led me to just leave it as is. my groups at 5 yards are 0.5- 1 inches. my groups at 7 yards is 1-2 inches. i have some experience with red dots from shooting ccos on the m4 rifle (i'm military) so i have a small idea of how to focus with red dots. my questions are: 1. should i go for a more precise zero again or just practice with the red dot more before i try to zero more? 2. the bench rest was a bit janky. feel like zeroing while completely holding the pistol without a sandbag or benchrest might be more conducive. is this a bad idea since a mechanical zero (gun clamped down) is technically a true zero?",guns

"executor responsibilities and estate firearms looking for adviceim the administrator of an estate that includes several handguns, shotguns, and rifles. theyre all in good condition, with serial numbers and purchase receipts neatly documented. nothing particularly collectible, just a well-maintained set. the estate is in eastern pennsylvania. i live in missouri. thats about a 1,000-mile gap (including illinois) and while id prefer to bring them home and work with friends i trust, im unsure about the legal and practical concerns of transporting that many firearms across state lines, especially where an overnight stop might be part of the itinerary. on the other hand, trying to sell locally in pa feels a bit risky to me. im not deeply involved in the gun world other than the few i own myself, and id hate to end up on the wrong end of a bad consignment deal or lowball offer from an unfamiliar ffl. if youve handled a situation like this, or just have solid advice, id appreciate your thoughts. would you transport them, sell them locally, consign, or explore another option? im just looking for a clean, legal, and fair way to handle this part of the estate without making it more difficult than it needs to be.",guns

"""dog tag"" for your guns?many years ago a friend of mine showed up after attending a show where they had a vender selling thin pieces of stainless shim stock that had your initials and an id number stamped in them. the idea was you could pull the butt plate or similar location off and this went under it as an additional id if the gun were stolen. at the time i had like 2 guns and both were ones that i begged people to steal! however i was asked the other day about anti-theft ideas and that popped into mind. just don't recall the vendor or if it was still a thing. anyone remember these or maybe knows of a source for them?",guns

"advice would appreciate some input from more experienced gun owners about qd attachment for my rifle's suppressor. (tldr included)i have a ruger american predator gen 1 rifle that i recently bought a suppressor for. today i finally got the confirmation that my eform 4 was approved. initially in my search for suppressors i was fairly sure i would go with a dead air can, specifically one from the sandman line, so i went ahead and bought a keymo ready muzzle brake. after weighing the options and budgeting i decided to go with a cheaper can without the keymo qd system. my question to y'all is: is it worth it to spend the extra 200-250 on a hub adapter or should i just eat the cost of the 70 muzzle brake? is there significant performance i would be leaving on the table if i don't get the adapter? i plan to use this can consistently and its my only rifle so i wouldn't be swapping it to another firearm regularly, if ever. thank you. tldr: should i spend the money on keymo qd adapter or just remove mb and thread the suppressor directly?",guns
"crossed thumb revolver grip?i was always told that on smaller revolvers, using a crossed thumb grip it a totally viable grip especially with big hands. the only experience i have is with larger revolvers (.357, 460 magnum) and i know for sure it is a terrible idea with them. but recently i had an itch to start browsing smaller revolvers (j-frame) so i went to my local mom and pop just to get an idea of just how small they are compared to the bigger stuff. point being made here, i went to the shop and started experimenting with grips because j-frames are much smaller than i realize. go figure i started with cross thumb and the guy behind the counter starting berating me about it being the worst possible grip and if i don't break such a terrible habit i probably shouldn't consider buying one. just curious, does crossed thumb grip have a bad rap? does it actually make that big of a difference for smaller carry revolvers like the 642? no experience with them, so i'm assuming based on his reaction people really don't like it? just curious because the normal thumb over thumb grip i use on my revolvers felt real awkward on all the small revolvers i approached. crossed definitely wasn't what i'm used to, but it felt a little bit less awkward in the hand.",guns

"a question regarding surefire x300hello folks, i have a question for folks who carryuse the surefire x300 weapon mounted light (wml). i recently picked one up, having never really used one before, and encountered a slight complication i hadn't accounted for. chiefly, i struggle with actuating the the switch, my hands are perhaps a bit on the smaller side (i believe i wear a medium glove) and the pistol i have it mounted to has an oversized trigger guard. so the switch is further forward than i can reach easily. while i can activate the light with my support hand's thumb i can't easily switch it back into the ""off"" position without breaking my grip. largely i believe the issue is a combination of my hand size and how far forward the light sits. i could of course place it on another pistol that mounts it closer but that's not the purpose of this post. for anyone that has encountered a similar issue, how did you address or work around this? will the switch on the x300 loosen up with use and become easier to actuate or will i need to practice a technique to workaround this particular challenge? i appreciate any input and feedback anyone can provide, or even just your own anecdotal accounts of working with this wpl. thanks in advance.",guns

"house got broken into. many firearms stolen. learn from my mistakes.i came home on thursday to my house broken into. fucker got most of my firearms, though they missed a few. long story short, learn from me: 1. never leave your safe unlocked. i got complacent and that's how so many were stolen. i was working on several firearms, rearranging the safe, and stupidly left it open. i've had this safe for 10 years, but it just takes one day for someone to break in. 2. write down every firearm make, model, and serial number you own and keep that information in a safe place that is easily accessed. include details like finish, barrel length, modifications, scope brand and model, and calibergauge. i live in ca and the sheriff was able to pull my sales records, but several rifles and shotguns weren't in the records because ca somewhat recently started keeping track of serial numbers for riflesshotguns. politics aside, it was actually a blessing that they were able to track most of what was stolen. trying to track down serial numbers is a bitch, especially if they were purchases long ago like many of mine were. gunbroker transactions only go back 90 days (wtf?). many warhorses i bought were like 15 years ago and looking for the website i bought them from was fruitless; even if you ask the ffl where you transferred them from, how many years of records do they keep? how could they easily search for them? 3. invest in security cameras now. i got blink wireless cameras that detect motion and send me a text alert when they notice something. 4. talk to your neighbors and establish relationships. i live in a rural area and my only close neighbor literally saw a strange pickup truck on my property but figured i hired a contractor to do something. if he would have contacted me, i could have immediately called the cops and told them something was afoot. what a lost opportunity. 5. i also lost pellet guns that obviously don't go through an ffl. unfortunately the one that was stolen was a very high end rifle and unless a miracle happens, i'll never see it again. serial number is key, and i don't have it. 6. while you're writing down serial numbers for firearms, write down serial numbers for anything valuable. the thief didn't notice my digital camera, my ipad, my laptop, and all my top tier hifi audio gear. i was lucky for those things not being stolen, but unless you have a serial number, good luck ever proving ownership. there is nothing more gutting than coming home and realizing your house has been broken into. please take my advice to prevent this from happening to you, or at worst, you'll have evidence to provide to police. i have several non-firearms related things stolen that i never expect to see again (mountain bike, pressure washer, guitars, gas cans, etc) but police do not like stolen firearms and they will work that case. give them all the information you possibly can and hopefully you prevent a theft but if it happens, you can give them as much information as possible. update: a neighbor has a camera system that got footage of the truck coming and going. no license plate but he got video of both sides of the truck including body damage, paint damage and custom rims. he's saying you'd easily be able to identify this truck out in the wild if you saw it. i'm waiting for the neighbor to figure out how to download the video and provide it to me, it's killing me inside not having it. i really want to see if the driver is at all recognizable. update 2: the cameras didn't get a license plate number and the driver is too blurry to identify, but it's not a truck i recognize. this is not looking like it was done by someone i know. i've posted the photos on nextdoor and facebook, and someone said they thought they saw the truck at a local recycling place on saturday. said recycling place has cameras and records ids so the sheriff is investigating. i've also shown gas station attendants where i'm a regular and one particular place said they thought the truck looked familiar from the distinct body damage. here's hoping something pans out.",guns

"i call this 2013 chic ""remington 870 and mossberg 590""mossberg 590 with a full length breacher barrel for whatever reason, and a remington 870 with a lot going on. the 870 has a mesa high tube adapter, a b&t pump tri rail with an m249 grip on it, hk416 iron sights, and an aridus side saddle. i'm think about having a custom full length top rail made for this gun so that i can have any semblance of a sight radius, but this is where we are now. i am currently saving up to send the entire mossberg to vang comp and have them do there tactical upgrade service to it. having real iron sights on this gun would be real great. i'd also like to see if i can find a mossberh 590a1 bayonet lug for them to silver solder to the barrel. a full length breacher barrel with a bayonet sounds so ridiculous that i want to do it of i can. it in a way reminds me of that weird trend in the early to mid 2010's where everything was zombie apocalypse, and over the top. maybe mossberg sells the bayonet lug as a standoff alone part to gunsmiths, i don't know. i may have to reach out to my dude, or vang comp (when i'm ready to do the upgrade, which may take a while depending on what else i have going on in life). the 870 has a bit of work left to do on it. i want to send the barrel to vang comp, and possibly install a full length top rail verry similar to the s&j stock adaptors from the early 2000's. i also have a mesa tactical m4 stock ammo holder coming in the mail. the other thing that i have coming in is a picatinny rail to mount on the right side of the stock where the qd point is. i grabbed it because it is fits the high tube rail, but i don't know what to put on the thing. i'm open to suggestions if yall have any ideas. i did have to do a little bit of hand fitting to make the aridus side saddle work with the mesa high tube adapter.",guns

poor customer service in the industryjust curious if anyone has had any dealings with balwin bolt jeweling and carbonsix? i've been dealing with both of these companies and the customer service is garbage imo. ive had a barrel on order from c6 for 9 months now and keep getting either bs run around responses from them or no response at all. baldwin bolt jeweling has had a couple bolts for a month and a half and i can't get any response from the guy at all! what sucks the most is that both companies were great to start with so i went ahead with them. this also seems to be kind of the trend with a few others in the industry. i know if we had this type of service at my boat shop we would be out of business in no time!,guns
"hybrid sights or lpvo on bolt action recommendationsgday lads, looking for recommendations for an optic setup for my browning x bolt 375h&h. use will mostly be close range wild boar and maybe some deer. it wont be the primary firearm on a trip, i have a 4-12x .308 setup for that. just something for a bit of fun thats got plenty of kick. priority is quick target acquisition but with the versatility of some low powered zoom, will also be using in dawn and dusk situations so low light performance is a factor. naturally i was leaning towards a hybrid setup: an eotech reflex with their g45 magnifier however when taking some measurements i dont think i could comfortably get close enough for the max eye relief of 2.6inch although its definitely doable just doesnt seem optimal. others have run optics like the aimpoint micro h-1 on bolt action rifles in this scenario, id just like to get some magnification benefits but seem to be striking out when it comes to eye relief. if theres any recommendations or better setup ideas id be grateful",guns

"wife finally fought her own gunedit: she bought her first gun, sorry for the accidental click bait lol after about 4 years of being together, my wife surprised me one morning recently by saying i want to buy a gun and get my ccw. she started out being pretty anti gun as a result of anti-gun propaganda and being raised in a household that didnt talk about guns. after a two years of being together, i bought my first gun and started the ccw process due to increased crime in our area. i only bought the gun after discussing it at length with her and making sure she was comfortable with having one in our apartment. after a few months of conversations she finally agreed to a tan pistol because the black ones were scary lol. a little while later, we got a tan shotgun because the black ones were still scary to her but turns out, she really liked shooting the shotgun. the pistol is a bit much for her to handle because of the recoil but she loves the shotgun. fast forward two years and we have seen more crime, found ourselves in several situations where a ccw would have been nice to have (local ccw permit takes about two years), and overall just got her more comfortable with the idea of guns. about a month ago i got my ccw and have been carrying every day since. we also got married and have started talking about kids in these last two years. i floated the idea of her eventually getting her own ccw since she will at some point be alone with our future kids and that it would be smart for her to have an option of self defense. since the process takes two years, she could get the gun now and take time to get used to it, learn how to shoot it, and once she gets it she doesnt have to carry every single day but she would at least have the option to. she sat on that for a few weeks and the other day told me she decided she wanted to get her own gun. we put a deposit down on an all black (she longer thinks the black guns are scary lol) g19 for off body carry (cross body bagfanny pack kinda thing) this last weekend. overall im super happy that she came to this decision on her own, i of course have helped her along but it was important to me that i never forced the gun issue on her. i wanted her to own the decision to get a gun and now she is planning on carrying while raising our future kids. lessons learned for other guys (or girls) in the same situation: - find a gun store that will treat your wife with respect, the first store we went into the guy opened the conversation with how about a pink gun for the little lady and we immediately walked out. she didnt want to step foot in a gun store again for a while. we eventually found a store with a really nice female attendant who knows more about guns than any other attendant weve met, and she takes the time to explain things to my wife and i rather than just treating us like idiots. she made a huge difference in making my wife comfortable with guns - maybe dont start with a gun that has a lot of recoil. my m&p shield was very snappy and takes a lot of effort to control the recoil, this initially scared her away from pistols. my wife loves shooting our maverick 88 and ruger pcc. - be patient, dont force anything. if you want long term success, your wife has to be part of the decision making process. dont force her to do things she isnt comfortable with at the range either. at first, she would frequently step outside of the range because the noiseshockwaves of nearby larger guns would make her uncomfortable. we have found that we both enjoy outdoor ranges more for this reason - be willing to make compromises. i bought a tan m&p shield instead of the black one because she didnt like the black ones. does the color make a difference? to her it did, it made it more comfortable for her for some reason. so thats what we went with. now look at her, she is going to be the proud owner of an all black glock 19 lol - make shooting a fun sport, not just about self defense. initially, she didnt want to think about having to use a gun in self defense. however, she liked the competitive aspect of shooting trap with the shotgun and target shooting with the ruger pcc. when she would come to the range with me, we wouldnt use body silhouette targets, instead we would use playing card targets or others that our range has available. overall, listen to your wife and be patient lol. im super proud of her for taking such a big step towards helping protect our family and exercising her second amendment right",guns

can i fire .270 winchester rounds in a barrel stamped .270 wby?i was gifted a weatherby .270 mark v ultralight. when buying ammo i bought .270 winchester but stamped on the barrel is .270 wby. from what i have read the difference is that .270 wby has a slightly larger casing and will produce roughly 200 more fps. everything else appears to be the same. so my question is - can i safely fire .270 winchester in the barrel stamped .270 wby?,guns
"just got my non resident puerto rico firearm licensemy own update: i applied for my non resident on december 12,2024 dec 11 did my firearm class with live fire 4 hours 160.00 dec 11 went to codepola. gun club in trujillo alto and joined for 120 a year. they took my picture filled out my application, took copies of all ids and social security card . notarized my application. they also sold me tax stamps that would be needed to pay for the actual license at the police station. they also set up my appointment for the next day at police station in san juan. they put my packadge together and explained exactly what to do. only thing was. they told me i might need a pr resident address. they said it depended on the agent i spoke to. i have family in pr so i asked my cousin to email me a copy of light bill and scan of license. which i ended up needing dec 12: went to to police station 8am appointment. turned in package. agent went over it with a check list. told me i needed to be fingerprinted and get a pr criminal background check. but not to worry just go to first floor and i get both there. went down got printed and after buying a 2.50 tax stamp at a vending machine i proceeded to the window for criminal check gave them stamp with my filled out form. sat for about 2 minutes. was called and given my certificate of ""good boy"" went back upstairs finished the application process agent scanned everything into system returned package with a number written on it and told me 30 to 45 days. and i had to personally pick it up. now the wait turned out to be longer because 45 days did not count weekends christmas eve, christmas day, day after christmas, new years eve, new years day. 3 kings day.....lol. i couldnt return till april 17th. but went in and asked about it. agent asked for id, and went into the back and came out with my new pr licensia de armas good for 5 years. which i signed for receiving it. it is costly, 160 for class, 200 for initial application, 2.50 for pr background check. but it was really not too bad. if you go at it alone it could be a little confusing but i wholly recommend codepola. they made the process very easy did all the heavy work with the application. with the 120 i got that service. they also have lawyers on call that deal with gun laws in pr in case of anything. they have shooting events and gun stores across the island. hope this update helps anyone intetested",guns

""	aftermarket parts are cheap and easy to find. ""	.40 frames are overbuilt perfect for 9mm conversions. ""	id get another caliber (full .40 setup), plus still have the option to easily convert to 9mm or .357 sig whenever i want. ""	could either keep it cheap with just a barrel swap, or throw on a complete new slide and really build it out. ""	would be a fun project gun, and i could piece it together over time instead of dropping a bunch of money at once. ""	also people saying .40 is dead dont really know what theyre talking about. the same modern ammo tech that made 9mm better also made .40 better. shot placement still wins fights, but .40 will always hit harder than 9mm, plain and simple. cons: ""	costs do add up barrel, slide, internals, sights, etc. ""	gen 3s definitely feel a little dated compared to newer guns. ""	i already have way better 9mm pistols ready to go. ""	.40 isnt the cool caliber anymore unless you actually know why youre using it. bottom line: probably not the smartest practical move, but if i can find a g23 or g27 cheap, its a cool way to get another caliber plus a multi-role gun, and have a fun project at the same time. anybody else go down this rabbit hole and build a 23 or 27 into a 1926 setup? worth it or waste of money?",guns

".22lr conversion kitshi all, i tried searching the subreddit for an existing thread that answers this, but didn't find anything recent or directly related to my question, so i apologize if i'm asking something that has been answered a million times. i've been thinking about picking up a .22lr pistol for a myriad of reasons, the chief among them being a funeasy pistol for my wife to shoot. she is not terribly experienced with them, but enjoys shooting. i have a fair amount of experience around guns, but i'm nowhere near an expert when it comes to picking them. i own a glock 19, and i'm considering buying a ruger p95 (2012 if it matters) from a buddy. i'm very tempted to pick up a conversion kit for my 19, or if such a thing exists for the ruger, i may be open to that instead. if i'm allowed to tack on a side question, is the p95 any good? i know nothing about it, and trying to find information of any kind about the exact model has been a challenge for me. from the posts i did find here, it seems that glock conversion kits are a bit touchy about ammo. if that was true, is it still? and generally speaking, are conversion kits a good option, or is it best to pick up a separate gun? again, i hope this post is allowed. thanks in advance. edit to add: i am on a pretty tight budget for this at the moment, but i would rather wait if budget options are terrible. second edit: i live in missouri, so most options are available to me.",guns

"21a bobcat dropping hammer when safety is disengaged. i'm assuming this isn't normal?https:imgur.comajvdctor(https:imgur.comajvdctor) i inadvertently discovered a strange quirk with my new bobcat. i'm used to shooting striker fired handguns without safeties, so sometimes i forget that i have to disengage a safety when firing single action pistols like this. anyways, if the trigger is pulled with the safety engaged, and then safety subsequently disengaged, said disengaging of safety will drop the hammer. i noticed that pulling the trigger with the safety engaged actually drops the hammer, but the hammer is, i assume, being caught by the safety. i'm assuming there's a third sear notch on the hammer and a corresponding sear on the safety. i'm assuming though that's redundant, and secondary to the trigger block safety. i can't imagine what the trigger block safety is even there for if we're essentially relying on the safety to catch the hammer as a primary mechanism. i can't see inside of it, i can only see the trigger block safety with the grip removed, so not quite sure what's going on in there. it doesn't appear that the hammer is striking the firing pin, and i haven't tried this with live ammunition to test yet. i believe that the hammer is being caught by the half cock notch. the trigger block safety does appear to be working for double action. i.e. if the hammer is at half cock with the safety on, the trigger can't be pulled far enough to drop the hammer. i'm not sure why it works in double action mode and not single action.",guns

"recent past gun loregospel that is now anything but gospel?i was thinking back to when i purchased my first handgun (eg. i was old enough and had the coin to go to a store and buy it for myself). this was in something like 2001-2002. back then dasa semiautomatics were far more prevalent than nowadays. i remember picking out some shitty taurus (hey, i earned minimum wage working at the library of my university at the time). it was 9mm. i will never forget this smug, older (guessing in his 40's), dickhead that was standing nearby and said something like ""9mm? psssh, you're just gonna make someone mad with dat! 40 is a real caliber!"". strangely, he didn't volunteer to test his claim, which he said with maximum smug authority. back then, there were plenty of people that thought the way that gun store primate thought. it brings a smile to my face every time that memory pops into my head. i wonder what mr. fotay is up to these days. did he capitulate and sheepishly trade his 40s in for 9mm? does he vociferously defend the 40 on the internets in the face of its clear decline in popularity? does he ignorantly continue to spend too much money on his ammo and struggle with follow up shots? does he not have time to shoot because he spends his days worrying about when he needs to change his colostomy bag? ok, the last is below the belt, but 2001 was a long time ago now, he's getting up there in years. being involved with guns and discussions of them on the internet for over a quarter century, a lot of fads have come and gone, a lot of gun gospel has changed and even done full 180 degree course changes. le departments seem to be dropping the 40 at increasing pace and its popularity amongst non-le has never been lower in my gun ownership lifetime. things done changed since that day i bought that taurus (i sold it 5 years later, sort of wish i had kept it as a memento, it will always have a special place in my heart). keep in mind that federal hydrashoks were already prevalent at the time, it had zero to do with ""advances in 9mm ammo"" in 2001. what other ""common knowledge"" or consensus ideas of the recent past are now dead? i feel like lasers were still considered the hotness back then. night sights too, if you didn't have tritium you were definitely gonna die in a gun fight after dusk. those clipdraw ""holsters"" for glocks seemed to be considered perfectly acceptable to a majority of people then. the massad ayoob idea that if you changed anything about your carry gun you would end up in a fed pen for life was certainly prevalent (same with any gun incident involving a title ii item... that's nfa for you newbs). everyone was counting down days until they could mount a bayonet on their ar15 (i admit, i was one also).... totally useless. anything other than metal usgi mags were looked at with enormous skepticism (ar15). hell, even a decent number of people were still apprehensiveskeptical of those plastic ""gangster"" guns that are recognized as possibly the most reliable factory pistols known as glocks. so what else?",guns
"who has the record for the longest opticsplanet backorder that eventually arrived?and is it me? tl:dr i just had the final item from my order arrive today, almost 21 months to the day after the rest of it. i had been chatting with my father, and he mentioned to me that due to some issues in his neighborhood, he wanted to take his old unused turkey gun and set it up more appropriately for home defense. he asked if i knew where to source a shorter barrel and longer magazine tube for his mossberg. no problem, i told him, i've already got one you can have. i'd bought a pistol grip only mossberg 590 several years earlier than this. at that time, a factory shockwave wasn't even an option, but you could find the parts reference numbers online to call them up, and they might let you order a 14 inch barrel and all the associated hardware. i'd picked one up with the intention of setting it up in that sort of configuration, but i only got as far as replacing the standard pistol grip before life got in the way, and i never bothered with the rest. so, i look online and see that op is now selling complete 14 inch kits. great! i tell dad he can have the 20 inch barrel and full length magazine tube off of mine to tactical up his turkey gun, and i place my order, excited that i'm finally going to set up my stupid meme gun like i originally wanted it. while i'm shopping, i also order an insert to use mini shells, and a nice laser for it too. might as well do it up properly. i get a brief hiccup in the next day or two when either op or my bank had an issue with billing me while shipping to my dad's house, and i get that all resolved, but apparently during that time my barrel kit goes on backorder. whatever, i wasn't in a rush anyway, and it can't be that long for something so popular, right? the rest of my order ships and arrives just fine, but the barrel kit is just continually delayed over and over. it was only by a week or two at first, then they sent an email saying estimated ship date would be in 6 months, and then i never heard from them again. until a week ago. took a little back and forth as my cc info was out of date, but my complete 14 inch barrel kit finally arrived today, to complete the rest of the order that originally arrived on august 2nd, 2023. i'm not into any rnfa stuff, but i feel like i can empathize when they talk about waiting periods.",guns

"marschalgrips review (for future reference)this is a quick review of wooden grips for my beretta 72 from (marschalgrips.net) i'm writing this as i was skeptical back then when ordering them as fhey have no google or trustpilot reviews. so for anybody that wants handmade wood grips from hungary, you can trust him. the grips themselves are pretty good (i don't have many other grips to compare though.) but it took a while for him to produce it and ship it (i think like 2 months in total, not sure.) so be careful if the grips for your pistol are not already produced yet. all in all i am happy and think that he deserves a good review. 45 is a fair score.",guns
"what difference does the ""usa"" model make in a cz usa p-10 f?first time hand gun buyer and i was looking at grabbing the glock 17 gen 5 since i've used that one before and everyone seems to agree that it's the toyota corolla of handguns for new users - i.e. you can't go wrong. but then i saw the cz usa p-10 f for almost 150 less. it seems like a better fit for my hand and the trigger is... nicer. plus 19 rounds instead of 17. so i looked at reviews and everyone says it's great - comparable to the g17 in some ways but some even say they like it better. i guess my question is... the ""usa"" part of that. what makes it different? why is it so much cheaper? it seems to be the same in every way except the price is better. is this a tariff thing?",guns

"lesson learnedlast night i was sleeping and was awaken when heard a bang, sounded like my patio door had been forced open. i awoke, jumped up, grabbed my 300 blk out pistol with a red dot, brought it up to my eye and saw nothing but a giant red blur in my eye. in the end it turned out my wife and dog were watching tv in the living room, th dog had to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night and my wife accidentally slammed the patio door letting him out. lesson. the lesson i learned is that eventhough i had previously tested my red dots brightness in total darkness, i did not account for the fact that my eye would be light sensitive if i'm just awaking from sleep. same as if you turn on the bathtoom light on in the middle of the night your eyes will be overloaded. solution. 1x prism. the red dot brightness has to be turned so low for low light that its not visible during the day or so bright for day that it overloads my eyes at night. the prism can be set low for night but is still visible in daylight bc the reticle is etched into the glass. i have two 1x prisms on other guns. a pcc and ar and i love them. i know some will suggest a red dot that self-adjusts brightness based on ambient light conditions. i have never tried one but have heard they suffer the issue of if youre in dim light aiming out into brightness then dot visibility suffers.",guns

"hell me find a gun from when i was younger.so, my grandad had a semi auto .44 carbine. from what i remember it's similar to the ruger .44 carbine. but, i seem to remember it having a side load, similar to a lever gun. not a bottom load like i see for many rugers. it was able to have scope mounts drilled for it, no rail. had a brass looking butt plate and not quite a full stock. the fore and butt were, as i remember it, separate. but this was also 20 years ago. i got to thinking about it a bit ago, and it was the last gun i used when i shot my last deer. and i would love to have one. i'm pretty sure it went to an aunt or uncle when grandad died, it's possible my dad has it though. i haven't asked him, but probably will next month when i see him. dad don't like talking about guns over the phone. it was probably bought no later than the late 80's or mid 90's. i last shot it around 1999-2001. but it honestly could have been a much older gun than that. it's entirely possible it's the ruger, but all pictures i see of that one, just don't seem to fit what i remember. i'm in my 40s now. i was probably 16-18 last time i saw it. so, i may be remembering completely wrong.",guns

""this letter is in response to your challenge. you were denied at the time based on the following: title 18, united states code, section 922(g)(2): a person who is a fugitive from justice. the prohibitor is indicative of an active felony or misdemeanor warrant which has to meet three criteria: the person is subject to a current or pendingpotential criminal prosecution or criminal testimonial obligation (e.g., expert witness, material witness, victim, or informant); and the person has left the state; and the person has done so to avoid prosecution for a crime or to avoid giving testimony in a criminal proceeding (e.g., expert witness, material witness, victim, or informant). although you were prohibited when this transaction was initiated, the fbis criminal justice information services (cjis) division was able to determine that you are not prohibited at this time. if you attempt to purchase in the future, a complete national instant criminal background check system (nics) background check will be conducted to ensure there are no additional prohibitions."" we are so back boys!!!

"left eye dominant, right or left handed bolt? (also: what contour?)i'm looking to buy a bolt, but can't decide on a right or left handed one. i always shoot right handed for pistols and left handed for riflesshotguns. it's always awkward when i shoot bolts standing because i have to remove my support hand to rack the bolt and then re-align my shot. it's fun shooting old milsurp bolts, but never really feels ""right"". i've seen people recommend levers of which i own three and they are fine, however i'm looking into trying to build something for a kind of huntingprecision shooting for fun kind of thing. will probably be used mostly for bench shooting, however i'd like the option to take it out hunting. i feel a right handed bolt would be better than a lefty when pronebenched as i wouldn't really need my support hand to hold the end of the rifle up so i could use it to more quickly run the action. however i feel a left handed rifle might be easier standing as i could keep my right hand supporting the end of the rifle and work the action with my left. i know a replacement chassis would also be a pain to find for a left handed rifle. i know when i run a right handed bolt and keep my left hand at the ready while racking the bolt with my right hand it can come pretty close to nicking the left hand. i do plan to run a pistol grip instead though so i won't have to work about my hand being in the way of the bolt when cycling. if your a lefty, what do run with? do you find certain scenarios easier with one side than the other. i feel like running a right handed rifle would be easier in the long run as parts would be easier to find, however if you feel there is a large enough benefit then i might just have to be willing to put in the extra effort to make a left handed bolt be the choice. whilst on the subject which contour do you feel would give the best balance to lighter weight, but can be shot for a decent string without opening up too much. i plan to shoot it more benched than anything, but would also like the ability to take it out the field every now and again. so cutting some weight would be nice. no bull barrels or anything like that, but with all the different pulma and varmint and such it's hard to decide what the best one to go with would be. thank you guys i appreciate any recommendations you can give me.",guns

"psa dagger frame - hang fire trigger problem?i just got a complete psa dagger full sized frame because i had a spare aftermarket complete slide sitting around and they were on sale for 39. right out of the gate, the trigger is hang firing for lack of a better term when the trigger is held to the rear and the slide is cycled. the trigger has an audibletactile reset when this happens, but the next trigger pull is delayed, taking anywhere between 1 and 15 seconds of holding the trigger to the rear with constant pressure to release the striker and fire. it does not do this if you pull the trigger and release it prior to cycling the slide. doing so resets the trigger as normal. it has smoothed out a little, taking a little less time after 100 cycles, but still seems to be a problem. ive read that there are issues with the trigger resetting when using a non-psa slide on a dagger frame, but those problems seemed to cause dead triggers, not delayed firing. any idea what it could be?",guns
